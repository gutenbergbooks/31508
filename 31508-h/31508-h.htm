of scientific knowledge; not
through compulsion, but through democratic

<p>The betterment of living conditions,
through conscious endeavor, for the purpose
of securing efficient human beings, is what
the author means by <span class="smcap">Euthenics</span>.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Euthenics deals with race improvement

<p>Euthenics is hygiene for the present
generation.</p>

<p>Eugenics must await careful investigation.</p>

<p>Euthenics has immediate opportunity.</p>

<p>Euthenics precedes eugenics, developing
better men now, and thus inevitably
creating a better race of men in the future.
Euthenics is the term proposed for the preliminary
science on which Eugenics must be
based.</p>

<p>This new science seeks to emphasize the
immediate duty of man to better his conditions
by availing himself of knowledge already
at hand. As far as in him lies he must
make application of this knowledge to secure
his greatest efficiency under conditions
which he can create or under such existing
conditions as he may not be able wholly to
control, but such as he may modify. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
knowledge of the causes of disease tends
only to depress the average citizen rather
than to arouse him to combat it. Hope of
success will urge him forward, and it is the
duty of lovers of mankind to show all possible
ways of attaining the goal. The tendency
to hopelessness retards reformation and
regeneration, and the lack of belief in success
holds back the wheels of progress.</p>

<p>Euthenics is to be developed:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Through sanitary science.</li>
<li>2. Through education.</li>
<li>3. Through relating science and education to life.</li>
</ul>


<p>Students of sanitary science discover for
us the laws which make for health and the
prevention of disease. The laboratory has
been studying conditions and causes, and
now can show the way to many remedies.</p>

<p>A knowledge of these laws, of the means
of conserving man&#8217;s resources and vitality,
which will result in the wealth of human
energy, is more and more brought within
the reach of all by various educational
agencies.</p>

<p>The individual must estimate properly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
the value of this knowledge in its application
to daily life, in order to secure efficiency
and the greatest happiness for himself
and for the community.</p>

<p>Right living conditions comprise pure
food and a safe water supply, a clean and
disease-free atmosphere in which to live
and work, proper shelter, and the adjustment
of work, rest, and amusement. The
attainment of these conditions calls for
hearty co&ouml;peration between individual and
community&mdash;effort on the part of the individual
because the individual makes personality
a power; effort on the part of the
community because the strength of combined
endeavor is required to meet all great
problems.</p>

<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">S</span>uch</span> facts as the following, showing the
increase in health, or rather the decrease
in disease, go to prove what may be
done.</p>

<p>Since 1882, tuberculosis has decreased
forty-nine per cent; typhoid, thirty-nine
per cent. Statistics in regard to heart disease
and other troubles under personal control,
however, show increase&mdash;kidney disease,
131 per cent; heart disease, fifty-seven
per cent; apoplexy, eighty-four per cent.
This means that infectious and contagious
diseases, of which the State has taken cognizance
and to the suppression of which it
has applied known laws of science, have
been brought under control, and their existence
today is due only to the carelessness or
the ignorance of individuals.</p>

<p>On the other hand, such results of improper
personal living as do not come under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
legal control&mdash;diseases of the heart, kidneys,
and general degeneration, matters of
personal hygiene&mdash;have so enormously increased
as in themselves to show the attitude
of mind of the great mass of the people,
&#8220;Let us eat and drink and be merry,
what if we do die tomorrow!&#8221;</p>

<p>Probably not more than twenty-five per
cent in any community are doing a full
day&#8217;s work such as they would be capable
of doing if they were in perfect health.
This adds to the length of the school course,
to the cost of production in all directions,
to increased taxation, and decreases interest
in daily life.</p>

<p>The trouble is that the public does not
<i>believe</i> in this waste which comes from being
&#8220;just poorly&#8221; or &#8220;just so as to be about.&#8221;
It has no conception of the difference between
working with a clear brain and a
steady hand, and working with a dull and
nerveless tool. It must be convinced of this
in some way. General warnings have been
ineffective, and now the appeal is being
made to the American people on the basis of
money loss. Thus it has been carefully estimated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
that the average economic value of an
inhabitant of the United States is $2,900.
The vital statistics of the United States for
population give 85,500,000. Eighty-five
million five hundred thousand multiplied
by $2,900 equals $250,000,000,000 (minimum
estimate), and this exceeds the value
of <i>all other wealth</i>. The actual economic
saving possible annually in this country by
preventing needless deaths, needless illness,
and needless fatigue is certainly far greater
than $1,500,000,000, and may be three or
four times as great.</p>

<p>Dr. George M. Gould estimated that
sickness and death in the United States cost
$3,000,000,000 annually, of which at least
one-third is regarded as preventable.</p>

<p>From all sides comes testimony to the
decrease in personal efficiency of workers
of all degrees. Medical science has prolonged
life, hospitals and visiting nurses
have made sickness less distressful, but have
also in many cases prolonged the time and
increased the cost. Sanitary science aims to
prevent the beginnings of sickness, and so to
eliminate much of the expense.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>The discovery that the mosquito is the
carrying agent for the yellow fever germ
has saved more lives annually than were lost
in the Cuban War. In the yellow fever epidemic
of 1872, the loss to the country was
not less than $100,000,000 in gold.</p>

<p>&#8220;With our present population there are
always about 3,000,000 persons in the United
States on the sick list.... By means of Farr&#8217;s
table, we may calculate that very close to a
third, or 1,000,000 persons, are in the working
period of life. Assuming that average
earnings in the working period are $700,
and that only three-fourths of the 1,000,000
potential workers would be occupied, we
find over $500,000,000 as the minimum loss
of earnings.</p>

<p>&#8220;The cost of medical attendance, medicine
and nursing, etc., is conjectured by
Dr. Biggs in New York to be from $1.50
each per day for the consumptive poor to
a greater amount for other diseases and
classes. Applying this to the 3,000,000 years
of illness annually experienced, we have
$1,500,000,000 as the minimum annual cost
of this kind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;The statistics of the Commissioner of
Labor show that the expenditure for illness
and death amounts to twenty-seven dollars
per family per annum. This is for workingmen&#8217;s
families only. But even this figure,
if applied to the 17,000,000 families
of the United States, would make the total
bill caring for illness and death $460,000,000.
The true cost may well be more than
twice this sum. Certainly the estimate is
more than safe, and is only one-third of the
sum obtained by using Dr. Biggs&#8217;s estimate.
The sum of the costs of illness, including
loss of wages and cost of care, is thus $460,000,000
plus $500,000,000 equals $960,000,000....
At least three-quarters of the costs
are preventable.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The cost of certain preventable diseases
a year is estimated by various authorities as:</p>

<table summary="diseases">
<tr><td>Tuberculosis</td><td class="pageno">$1,000,000,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>Typhoid</td><td class="pageno">250,000,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>Malaria</td><td class="pageno">100,000,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>Other insect diseases</td><td class="pageno">100,000,000</td></tr>
</table>

<p>A hopeful sign of awakening is the endeavor
by life insurance companies to bring
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>home to the people the possibilities of race
betterment. One company sends out among
its policy holders trained nurses, who give
plain talks on health subjects and offer practical
suggestions as to hygienic living. This,
to be sure, is on the economic basis of money
saving, but if that is the only thing that
will appeal to the people is it not wise to
seize upon it as a lever to lift the standard
of well-being?</p>

<p>The possibility of saving the enormous
sums that are lost by reason of premature
deaths was an alluring subject to the insurance
men. It gave to the world what,
up to that time, it had lacked&mdash;a body of
powerful men who recognized that they
had a financial interest in preventing the
needless death of men and women.</p>

<p>A table has been prepared showing that
if insurance companies were to expend
$200,000 a year for the purely commercial
object of reducing their death losses, and
should thereby decrease them only twelve
one-hundredths of one per cent, they would
save enough to cover the expense.</p>

<p>&#8220;If such a plan as this were placed on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
a purely scientific basis and carried out by
good business methods, and all the companies
pulled together for the common
good, I should expect a decrease in death
claims of more than one per cent; and a
decrease in the death claims of one per cent
would mean that the companies would save
more than eight times as much as they expended,
or would make a net saving of more
than seven times the expense, which would
be about a million and a half dollars a
year.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;While it would be impossible to state in
general terms how rich a return lies ready
for public or private investments in good
health, these examples (life insurance)
show that the rate of this return is quite
beyond the dreams of avarice. Were it
possible for the public to realize this fact,
motives both of economy and of humanity
would dictate immediate and generous expenditure
of public moneys for improving
the air we breathe, the water we drink, the
food we eat, as well as for eliminating the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>dangers of life and limb which now surround
us.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Undoubtedly a moral force is to be
strengthened by spreading the biological
lesson that man cannot live to himself alone,
but that his acts or failure to act affect a
large number of his fellowmen. Also, a
stimulus to personal ambition is to be supplied
in the suggestion of better health and
consequently more money to spend as a
result.</p>

<p>Civic pride and private gain will be
brought into the endeavor to show man that
to understand himself, to exercise the same
control over his activities that he uses over
his machines, is to double his capacity, not
only for work, but for pleasure. This control
is now possible through the application
of recently confirmed scientific knowledge
as to man&#8217;s environment.</p>

<p>It is the aim of this book to arouse the
thinking portion of the community to the
opportunity of the present moment for inculcating
such standards of living as shall
tend to the increase of health and happiness.</p>

as the three potent watchwords of the New
Crusade. There is a real contagion of ideas
as well as of disease germs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<h3>FAITH</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> relation of environment to man&#8217;s
efficiency is a vital consideration: how
far it is responsible for his character, his
views, and his health; what special elements
in the environment are most potent and
what are the most readily controlled, provided
sufficient knowledge can be gained of
the forces and conditions to be used.</p>

<p>To this end home life&mdash;in its relations
to the child, the adult, and the community&mdash;is
considered in connection with the effect
on the home of the influences outside it, and
the reaction of each on the other. These
relations and influences are partly physical
and material, partly ethical and psychical.</p>

<p>The right of the child is protection, and
it is the responsibility of the adult&mdash;parent,
teacher, or state officer&mdash;to secure this protection.</p>

<p>The knowledge that investigators are
gaining in the laboratory and are trying to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
give to the community must be accepted and
applied by the individual. How is the individual,
discouraged by sickness and hardship,
to know that things are awry or that
they can be set more nearly straight? How
can he know that he is responsible for his
limitations? Why should he suppose that
he need not be eternally a slave to environment?
How can he realize that &#8220;health
promotes efficiency by producing more
energy and leaving it all free for useful
purposes?&#8221; A few enlightened souls recognize
the tendency of environment to kick
the man that is down; to be subservient to
the man of bodily and mental vigor, of keen
understanding and human insight, but the
majority must be led to believe these scientific
principles.</p>

<p>Again and again scientists and humanitarians
must return to the attack, for individual
carelessness becomes community
menace, and &#8220;line upon line and precept
upon precept&#8221; they must present their
knowledge in language that shall attract
and hold the attention and fancy. So the
work and discoveries of Metchnikoff have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
gained credence because the disciple who
described them had the ability to impress on
his audience in a convincing fashion the one
fact that made a strong appeal&mdash;the possibility
of long life. If those who are zealous
for any movement would study the psychology
of advertising and speak as forcefully
as the legitimate advertiser, they would be
more persuasive and successful.</p>

<p>When an idea has won in a certain circle,
it quickly spreads to the other members,
thence to active communities. So the universal
law of imitation may be the greatest
help in the spread of ideas. The individual
eats a certain food because his neighbor
does. Boston determines to make an effort
for a better city because Chicago has felt
the stirrings of civic pride.</p>

<p>A gifted individual with a deep sense
of the need of his community sees an ideal
condition, which by his thought becomes a
possibility. These beliefs he shares with a
few choice spirits till the circle has widened.
The new ideas come to the notice of
the city or the town officials, new means are
adopted of educating the whole community,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and, if necessary, legal measures are
passed. But the new means to betterment
must be applied by the individual. Beginning
with the exceptional individual and
ending with the average individual, the
perfect circle is rounded out.</p>

<p>The leaders must show convincingly
that the laws which they have discovered
may be applied to daily life, but the <i>individual
himself</i> must adopt them. When he
has been saturated with knowledge, his inertia
will break down, his hopelessness give
way to its very antithesis, a strong hope for
a better future. Every known method must
be used by the laboratory to develop this
hope into a belief wide enough to reach all
members of every section of the community
and deep enough to become a vital working
principle. Only through a belief strong
enough to ride over unbelief and inertia,
a belief in the value of science for personal
life strong enough to make a wise choice
possible, can the will to obtain a better
environment be developed. The belief in
better things must be thoroughly impressed
on the individual mind. Each individual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
must understand that it does affect <i>him</i>, that
it is <i>his</i> concern, that <i>he</i> must give heed to
his environment. Then he may have the
will and make the effort to combat dangers
to body and mind.</p>

<p>Today, belief is much more difficult than
ever before because the dangers are unseen
and insidious, and our enemies do not generally
make an appeal through the senses
of sight and hearing. But the dangers to
modern life are no less than in the days of
the pioneers, when a stockade was built as
a defense from the Indians. We have no
standards for safety. Our enemies are no
longer Indians and wild animals. Those
were the days of big things. Today is the
day of the infinitely little. To see our cruelest
enemies, we must use the microscope.
Of all our dangers, that of uncleanness leads&mdash;uncleanness
of food and water and air&mdash;uncleanness
due to unsanitary production
and storage, to exposure to street dust, or to
cooking and serving of food in unclean vessels.
Such conditions result not only in
actual disease, but in lowered vitality and
lessened work power.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Lack of knowledge on the part of some,
heedlessness on the part of others who
should be intelligent enough to interpret
such conditions, are responsible for their
continuance. A few timely suggestions
will accomplish more in remedying many
evils than any amount of attempted legal
enforcement. The very fact of a law makes
many persons defy it. They feel justified
in showing their wit by outwitting the
law&#8217;s representatives. Many of our newer
citizens have come to us from the protection
(?) of a personal authority that they
can see and feel. In this country of ours,
we have taken away that binding regard for
authority, and we must as far as possible
lead rather than compel.</p>

<p>It is, after all, what a man determines
for himself and for his family that affects
both his views of life and his wish to secure
for himself and for them that which he believes
to be best. It is not what some other
man believes for him that affects his life.</p>

<p>Evolution from within, not a dragging
from outside, even if it is in the right direction,
is the method of human development.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Nevertheless, if the bale of hay is skillfully
hung in front of the donkey&#8217;s nose it will
often serve to start the wheels on an easy
road.</p>

<p>Evidence of the value of concerted
effort by individuals and of the power of
suggestion was given by a woman&#8217;s club in
a small town. The members became aware
of the dangers in exposed food, and on investigation
found their own market to be
very low in standards of cleanness. At a
certain meeting they agreed to ask the proprietor
why he did not protect this and
cover that article. Certain members were
told off for the duty and the days agreed
upon. Mrs. A., making her usual purchases,
casually asked why such an article
was not covered. &#8220;I never thought about
it,&#8221; was the answer. Mrs. B., the next day,
asked why such an article was left out for
the flies. &#8220;I never thought about the flies.&#8221;
Mrs. C. asked the same question on the
third day. The proprietor said: &#8220;You&#8217;re
the third woman who has asked me that.
No one ever suggested it before, but it
would be a good idea.&#8221; Before the end of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
two weeks the provisions and groceries were
covered. The end had been gained without
resort to coercion.</p>

<p>We know that our capacity for mental
and bodily work depends on our supply of
food. Proper food is necessary as a source
of power for the work of the body as well
as to furnish material for growth and repair
of the losses of the body. Taking food is
the most interesting of the vital processes.
It appeals to all the senses (except hearing).</p>

<p>Professor Dawson calls attention to the
fact that the richest food areas in the world
have provided the most powerful stocks of
men of which we have any record, and it
has been pointed out by many that improper
food is closely connected with
mental and moral defects. Strong men and
women are not the product of improper
food. Dr. Stanley Hall says: &#8220;The necessity
of judicious, wholesome food is paramount....
You can educate a long time by
externals and not accomplish as much as
good feeding will accomplish by itself.
Children must be supplied with plenty of
nutritious food if they are to develop healthily
either in mind or body.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Hunter says: &#8220;All that we
are, either as individuals or as a complexly
constituted society of men, is made possible
by the food supply.... Perhaps more than
any other condition of life it lies at the
door of most of the social and mental inequalities
among men.&#8221;</p>

<p>In these days of irresponsibility there is
probably more harm done to the health by
ignoring physical law in the matter of eating
than in any other one thing.</p>

<p>It is in the study of food substances and
their possibilities in relation to better sanitary
conditions that the widest field is open
to housekeepers, and the subject should be
especially fascinating to women of education
and ability. All the skill and knowledge
of the best educated women should be
enlisted in the cause of better food for the
people. Certainly no subject, except that
of pure air, can have a closer bearing on the
health than right diet. Much sound teaching
will be needed before bad habits of
eating and drinking will be conquered.</p>

<p>A strong, well man whose work is muscular
and carried on in the open air, as is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
that of the farmer and of the fisherman,
will have the power to assimilate almost
anything, and can maintain abundant health
on the coarsest food poorly prepared, provided,
only, that it is abundant and composed
of the chemical constituents that the
body requires.</p>

<p>Only a small proportion of our people,
however, engage in work of this sort. The
majority are compelled by occupation, age,
or health to remain indoors. For them
nutritious, readily digested food is a requisite.
The farmer or the fisherman can
digest, even thrive upon, food which would
be deadly for a woman working in a factory.</p>

<p>In the fourth report of the Massachusetts
State Board of Health (1873),
Dr. Derby, the secretary, holds that &#8220;we
have good reason to believe that the many
forms of dyspepsia which are so commonly
met with among all classes in Massachusetts,
in country quite as much as in town,
are but too often the danger signal that
Nature gives us to show that the food, either
in its quality, or its preparation, or its variety,
is unsuited to maintain the vital processes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
If this warning is rejected, the result
of malnutrition is frequently chronic disease
of the so-called major class.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sanitation in relation to food deals first
with wholesome and clean materials&mdash;meat
from animals free from disease; fruit and
vegetables free from decay; milk, butter,
etc., free from harmful bacteria. The dangers
are the transference to the human body
of encysted organisms like trichina; of the
absorption of poisonous substances as toxins
or ptomaines; of the lodgment of germs of
disease along with dust on berries, rough
peach skins, crushed-open fruits; of dirt
clinging to lettuce, celery, and such vegetables
as are eaten raw.</p>

<p>For the next class of dangers we turn to
the handling of foods with unclean hands.</p>

<p>In countless ways disease is spread mysteriously,
all due to unclean habits. It is a
safe precaution to patronize only those restaurants
in which the waiters are evidently
trained to handle the food and vessels with
care. It will pay well to take care of one&#8217;s
hands and learn sanitary habits when one is
young; then one will do right without effort.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Whatever change of ideas may come with
increase of knowledge, these habits will not
need to be unlearned. Without knowing
the reasons for them, they have been proclaimed
in civilized lands.</p>

<p>It should be the part of the physicians
to take pains to advise, for most of our people
are accessible to ideas; yet from these
can come no improvement until the people
are convinced that it is needed. Just as soon
as the individual fully realizes that he himself
is to blame for his suffering or his
poverty in human energy, he will apply his
intelligence to the bettering of his condition.
If he can, in a short time, make as good a
showing as public effort has made in the
case of water supplies, he will accomplish
much for the race.</p>

<p>Of equal importance to food, in the
proper care of the human machine, comes
the air we breathe.</p>

<p>Many of man&#8217;s present physical troubles
are due to the roof over his head confining
the warmed, used-up air, which would escape
freely if there were an opening provided.
The first law of sanitation requires<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the quick removal of all wastes. Once-breathed
air is as much a waste as once-used
water, and should be allowed to escape.
Sewers are built for draining away used
water. Flues are just as important to serve
as sewers for used air. Air is lighter than
water, and out-breathed air being warmed
is lighter than that at room temperature.
It rises to the ceiling, where it will escape
if it is allowed to do so before it cools sufficiently
to fall.</p>

<p>The roof also keeps out sunlight, and
some late investigations indicate that glass
cuts off some of the most vitally important
light rays. The &#8220;glame&#8221; of the Ralstonites&mdash;&#8220;air
in motion with the sunlight on
it&#8221;&mdash;may have a scientific basis.</p>

<p>It will at once be retorted, &#8220;But we cannot
heat all out-of-doors.&#8221;</p>

<p>A partial reply is: Do not try to make
your house a tropical jungle. Travelers
assure us that such an atmosphere is not
conducive to work or to health.</p>

<p>All great nations have lived in a temperate
climate, where physical and mental activity
was possible for many hours a day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Science is more and more clearly giving
reasons for the cooler temperature in certain
physiological laws. The habits of life
in regard to air and food are largely under
individual, or at least under family control,
and should be studied as personal hygiene.</p>

<p>The lessons being so clearly taught in
the treatment of tuberculosis should be
heeded in forming the general living habits
of the people.</p>

<p>If loss of life can be lessened and working
power increased by man&#8217;s effort, why
does he not make the effort? Why are men
and women so apathetic over the prevalence
of disease? Why do they not devote their
energies to stamping it out? For no other
reason than their disbelief in the teachings
of science, coupled with a lingering superstition
that, after all, it is fate, not will
power, which rules the destinies of mankind.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is too much to expect that
a sturdy plant of belief should have grown
since the days of Edwin Chadwick and
Benjamin Ward Richardson (1830-50),
less than a century ago, when there were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
perhaps not a dozen men and women who
believed that man had any appreciable
control over his own health.</p>

<p>This early school of sanitarians endeavored
to &#8220;get behind fate, to the causes
of sickness.&#8221; The modern socionomist is,
by a study of the mental conditions of communities,
endeavoring to get behind the
causes of poverty and consequent suffering
to the reasons for <i>fatal indifference to dirt</i>.</p>

<p>It is well recognized that in severe sicknesses
of many kinds the will to get well is
more powerful than drugs, that something
which we call nerve force acting upon the
physical machine sends a vital current
through the arteries, coerces the heart to
renewed pumping action, and life comes
again to the blanched cheek and glazing
eye. This more often happens by a mental
stimulus than by any medicine. In like
manner the improvement of the body&#8217;s
shell, the home, like that of the soul&#8217;s shell,
the body, comes more often from an inward
impulse than from outward coercion.</p>

<p>Appeal to the loving but listless parent
will reach the heart quickest through love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
for the child. Therefore stress should be
laid on the child, its habits, its surroundings,
its ideals. By ideals is meant the very
real stimulus to action coming from within.
Action must come through the material
things which ideals control and through
which they express themselves.</p>

<p>Certain notions which have crept into
popular currency need to be corrected before
the individual can free himself from
bondage sufficiently to attempt constructive
advance and improvement.</p>

<p>Only a small percentage of adults obtain
the full efficiency from the human machine&mdash;the
only means they have of living, working,
enjoying. They permit themselves to
stand and walk badly, they breathe with
only a portion of their lungs, and so fail
to furnish the blood stream with oxygen.
They dress unhygienically. They eat
wrongly. They exercise little. In short,
they subject their bodies to abusive treatment
which would ruin any machine. Because
retribution does not instantly follow
infraction of Nature&#8217;s laws, they become
callous and unbelieving. Economy and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
efficiency in human time and strength is
one of the lessons to be taught the young
people, so that they may not waste their
patrimony.</p>

<p>The youth feels as rich in his fifty years
to come as he does with a legacy of $50,000
in the bank. The years, however, can yield
only small variations from the established
rate of interest. The human machine can
manufacture only a limited amount of
energy. It remains to utilize that quantity
to the best advantage. This can be done
only by having a purpose in life strong
enough to resist alluring temptations to
fritter away both time and strength.</p>

<p>One of the world&#8217;s busy workers found
that the distractions of urban life were
breaking in upon his working time and
making inroads upon his physical vitality.
He recognized that work for the body and
work for the mind must be balanced, and he
evolved an acrostic to be followed as a rule
of life, the fulfillment of which has meant
prolonged years of efficient work and has
kept the freshness of middle life with the
advancing years. Taking the six days of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the week as a unit, the acrostic is as
follows:</p>

<table summary="the feast of life">
<tr><th colspan="3"><i>The Feast of Life</i></th></tr>

<tr><td>F</td><td style="padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em">Food</td><td>One-tenth the time</td></tr>
<tr><td>E</td><td style="padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em">Exercise</td><td>One-tenth the time</td></tr>
<tr><td>A</td><td style="padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em">Amusement</td><td>One-tenth the time</td></tr>
<tr><td>S</td><td style="padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em">Sleep</td><td>Three-tenths the time</td></tr>
<tr><td>T</td><td style="padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em">Task</td><td>Four-tenths the time</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="newchapter">The first and last are nearly fixed quantities,
the other three may vary within certain
limits as to amount of time given and intensity
of effort. Amusement and exercise may
be taken together; exercise and sleep may
be somewhat interchangeable.</p>

<p>The task, or daily work, is a necessity for
mental and physical health. It should be
accepted as a part of human life and the
will and energy should be directed to doing
it well. It may be a pure delight, the most
entertaining thing that happens; <i>it should
be interesting</i>. It is astonishing how interesting
a dull piece of work may become if
one sets one&#8217;s self to doing it well. That
which one subconsciously knows one is doing
badly is drudgery. The real pleasure
in life comes not from so-called amusements&mdash;things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
done by other people to make one
laugh; to &#8220;take one&#8217;s mind off&#8221;&mdash;but from
seeing the work of one&#8217;s own hand and
brain prosper. The work of creation, of
transformation to desirable result, is the
purest joy the human mind can experience.
Fourteen hours a day is not too much for
this kind of task. The difficulty is to gain
skill of hand and eye, or training of mind,
to this end. A fallacy, a canker at the heart
of our social fabric today, is that the daily
task is something to be rid of.</p>

<p>The psychology of doing is clearly illustrated
in the character of Fool Billy, as
drawn by the author of &#8220;Priscilla of the
Good Intent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there nought ye like better than
idleness?&#8221; asked the blacksmith. &#8220;Think
now, Billy&mdash;just ponder over it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now,&#8221; answered the other, after
a silence, &#8220;there&#8217;s playing&mdash;what ye might
call playing at a right good game. Could
ye think of some likely pastime, David?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, could I; blowing bellows is the
grandest frolic ever I came across.&#8221; ...</p>

<p>&#8220;I doubt &#8217;tis work, David.... I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
shouldn&#8217;t like to be trapped into work.
&#8217;Twould scare me when I woke o&#8217; nights
and thought of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See ye then, Billy&#8221;&mdash;blowing the
bellows gently&mdash;&#8220;is it work to make yon
sparks go, blue and green and red, as fast
as ever ye like to drive &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Te-he, &#8217;tis just a bit o&#8217; sport&mdash;I hadn&#8217;t
thought of it in that light.&#8221; And soon he
was blowing steadily.</p>

<p>Later, when David the smith was going
to America and wished to leave his forge
with the half-witted Billy, he proposed the
smith&#8217;s work as play.</p>

<p>&#8220;Te-he,&#8221; laughed Billy, &#8220;am I to play
wi&#8217; all your fine tools, David?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, just that. I&#8217;ve taught ye the way
o&#8217; them and Dan Foster&#8217;s lad from Brow
Farm shall come and blow the bellows for
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will that be work for Dan Foster&#8217;s
lad, or play?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hard work, Billy&mdash;grievous hard
work, while you are just playing at making
horseshoes, fence railings, and what
not.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m to play at making horseshoes,&#8221;
went on Fool Billy, &#8220;while Dan
Foster&#8217;s lad&#8217;s sweating hard at bellows-blowing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<h3>HOPE</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> real significance of biological evolution
has not been grasped by the
people in general. It is that man is a part
of organic nature, subject to laws of development
and growth, laws which he cannot
break with impunity. It is his business to
study the forces of Nature and to conquer
his environment by submitting to the inevitable.
Only then will man gain control
of the conditions which affect his own
well-being.</p>

<p>Sickness, we know, is the result of breaking
some law of universal nature. What
that law may be, investigators in scores of
laboratories are endeavoring to determine.
In most diseases they have been successful.
Those remaining are being attacked on all
sides, and it may be confidently predicted
that a few years will see success assured.</p>

<p>Why, then, does sickness continue to be
the greatest drain upon individual and national<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
resources? Because man, through
ignorance or unbelief, will not avail himself
of this knowledge, or is behind the times in
his method. Where wisdom means effort
and discomfort, many feel it folly to be
wise.</p>

<p>The individual may be wise as to his
own needs, but powerless by himself to
secure the satisfaction of them. Certain
concessions to others&#8217; needs are always made
in family life. The community is only a
larger family group, and social consciousness
must in time take into account social
welfare. Moreover, a neighbor may pollute
the water supply, foul the air, and
adulterate the food. This is the penalty
paid for living in groups. Men band together,
therefore, to protect a common
water supply, to suppress smoke, dust, and
foul gases which render the common air unfit
to breathe. The State helps the group to
protect itself from bad food as it does from
destruction of property.</p>

<p>The development of fire protection is a
good example of community effort. The
isolated farmhouse may have buckets of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
water and blankets in an accessible place
with which to put out an incipient fire.
Then eight or ten families build close together.
The danger of one becomes the
danger of all, and a fire brigade is organized
that may protect all. When hundreds of
families crowd together in a small space
the danger becomes so much the greater
that a paid department with efficient apparatus
is necessary. No one complains of
the infraction of individual rights. Each
one is glad to pay his share of the expense.</p>

<p>In securing protection from other dangers,
the individual and the family unit are
fast relying on community regulations. In
fact, in many ways the individual, when he
becomes one of a crowd, must go whither
the crowd goes and at the same rate of
progress.</p>

<p>Failure to recognize that by coming into
the community he has forfeited his right to
unrestrained individuality causes an irritation
as unreasonable as harmful.</p>

<p>A certain control of sanitary conditions
must be delegated to the community and its
rules cheerfully followed. The legal aspects<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
of these rules will be considered in a
later chapter. Here is to be considered
only the <i>mental attitude</i> with which the
members of the community should come
together to agree upon a common defense
against disease and dirt. The spirit of co&ouml;peration
must prevail over a tendency to
antagonism when certain individual rights
seem to be involved.</p>

<p>Numbers of families living close together
are served by the same grocer or
market man. These families may agree
upon their requirements as to quality and
cleanliness and publish their rules. If they
do not take interest enough to protect themselves,
the community must make rules for
them. If the local officials are not vigilant
enough, the State may step in and compel
the observance of sanitary regulations.</p>

<p>The average citizen learns of the existence
of a health regulation when he is
warned that he has broken it, or perhaps is
fined. His first attitude is rebellion at the
invasion of his personal liberty. The housewife
usually takes the ground that the rule
is absurd or unnecessary.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>When, in the interest of the community,
any law is to be enforced, how are the people
to be led from this rebellious state of
mind? Perhaps first through authority.
In America we have learned to use the
phrase, &#8220;Big Stick.&#8221; Authority is exactly
that; it is coercion from without. It has
partial result in good; the law may be fulfilled
because the individual knows he must
obey when within the jurisdiction of that
law; but if the result is simply obedience
to authority and not to the underlying
principle, it will not be a force in his life
or be continued if by chance he can escape
it. He will be a &#8220;tramp&#8221; in his methods
of obedience. This method can never be
constructive; its value lies in the possibility
that by continuous usage or repetition the
procedure may become a habit, and from
habit will come reason and intelligence.</p>

<p>But the more direct and efficient way to
help the individual to realize his relation to
communal right living is through education.
The former method&mdash;blind obedience&mdash;will
foster the spirit of antagonism and call
the State&#8217;s protection &#8220;interference,&#8221; thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
weakening the efficiency of the State and of
the individual, for the State is the multiplication
of its citizens; but through the latter
method the individual will carry out the
law with intelligence and interest. This
will be constructive and it will be permanent,
for again, if the State is the sum of
its citizens, the efficiency of the State is the
sum of the efficiency of the citizens.</p>

<p>Their interests are now identical, the
man has become equal master with the
State; they are co-partners. His motive for
right living is greater than the letter of the
law, for he is the living law, the protest
against wrong and the fulfillment of the
right.</p>


<p style="padding-top: 1.5em">The next generation must be born with
healthy bodies, must be nurtured in healthy
physical and moral environments, and must
be filled with ambition to give birth to a
still healthier, still nobler generation. But,
as has been said, &#8220;whatever improvements
may sometime be achieved, the benefits of
their influence can be enjoyed only by
future, perhaps distantly future generations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
We of the present have to take our
heredity as we find it. We cannot follow
the advice of a humorous philosopher to
begin life by selecting our grandparents;
but through hygiene (sanitary science) we
can make the most of our endowment.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>There is a force in the development of
public opinion somewhere between individual
action and national compulsion
which may be termed &#8220;semi-public&#8221; action.
It is in a measure the same sort of influence
that in a later chapter is termed &#8220;stimulative
education.&#8221; For instance, a hospital
for the treatment of some special ailment is
needed. Private enterprise furnishes the
capital, proves the success of the treatment,
and then the community comes forward and
supports the institution. Such helps are
accepted freely and are not considered undemocratic.</p>

<p>The less spectacular but more effective
office of prevention of the need for charity,
in the maintenance of cleanness in the markets,
streets, and shops, yes, even in the
homes of the people, has been neglected.
Through lack of belief, and especially
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>through inattention to causes so common as
to escape notice, many details of great hygienic
importance have been overlooked.</p>

<p>Some daring ones in commercial ventures
are showing the possibilities of a
standard in cleanness, and model establishments,
dairies, bakeries, and restaurants
should receive the hearty support of a community.
If they do not receive this support,
it is more than discouraging to the
promoters, for <i>it costs to be clean</i>, a lesson
the community must learn. The saving of
money and the consequent loss of life
through disease, or the spending of money
and the saving of life through prevention,
are the alternatives.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the old view of charity as
tenderly caring for the sick&mdash;because there
must always be a certain amount of sickness
in the world&mdash;has held men back from
attempting to make a world without sickness.
The charity worker of the past had
no hope of really making things better
permanently.</p>

<p>The new view, based upon scientific
investigation, is that it is not charity that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
is needed to support invalids who once
stricken must fade away, but preventive
action to give the patient hope and fresh
air. Most important of all, the experience
already gained shows how far from
the truth was the old fatalistic notion of the
necessary continuance of disease.</p>

<p>While the support of many agencies&mdash;dispensaries,
clinics, hospitals, sanatoria,
etc.&mdash;must for a time depend upon private
philanthropy, the expense is in the nature
of an investment to bring in a high rate of
interest in the future welfare of the race.
As soon as the belief in the efficiency of
these agents reaches the taxpayer he will
willingly furnish the funds for public
agencies.</p>

<p>Today the child in the school is examined;
then, if need be, is given special consideration
at the dispensary, then sent to
school, where, with fresh air, pure food,
and hygienic surroundings, he will so
strengthen himself as to combat the ravages
of disease.</p>

<p>The Association for the Improvement
of the Condition of the Poor, New York<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
City, not only sends bread to fill the hungry
stomach, but now sends a wise and sympathetic
worker to help women to understand
food and money values, which means a permanent
help. And it no longer simply says
to the tired, worried woman who has had no
education-stimulus along the line of cleanness,
&#8220;Be clean,&#8221; but sends in women to
make the house an example, an exhibit of
clean conditions, if you will. Example is
stronger than precept.</p>

<p>In the rapid growth of cities, so often
beyond anticipation, preparation for development
or plans for extension have
seldom been laid. Much suffering has been
wrought to the families of men in our
crowded cities, for there is no greater evil
than the congestion of streets and buildings.</p>

<p>Many students of social conditions of
today believe that the most serious menace
is the situation best described as housing&mdash;the
site, the crowding, the bad building,
poor water supply and drainage, lack of
light and air and cleanliness. All believe
that it is economically a loss to the city in
general, however profitable to a very few.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
To rent such buildings is a far greater crime
than cruelty to animals or even the beating
of women and children.</p>

<p>But groups of people the wide world
over are keenly awake to this state of affairs,
and though the problem is tremendous they
are trying in numerous ways to solve it.</p>

<p>In some cities there are at present organizations
urging &#8220;city planning,&#8221; while in
several foreign cities the municipality has
already made regulations. In some cities
there are municipal model tenements, but
this is still a project of too small proportions
to affect the community.</p>

<p>Perhaps no modern movement that comprehends
both the city planning and the
housing of the working people is more ideal
than the &#8220;Garden Cities&#8221; movement in
England and the other countries following
it.</p>

<p>If there is any spot on which the hand
of the law should be laid, it is the congested
districts in cities and mill villages. The
evil has grown to such magnitude that the
first steps will mean some drastic measures.</p>

<p>The author has elsewhere called it the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
<i>Capitalists&#8217; Opportunity</i>. Instead of investing
in an uncertain gold mine in some distant
land, let the millions, for no less sum
will suffice, be invested in a plot of land,
whether an open field or a slum district
depends on local conditions, and thereon
cause to be erected habitations decently
comfortable, wholly sanitary, and place
over each group an inspector as both agent
and teacher who shall be a friend to the
tenants, and to whose office they may come
freely with their needs. This plan has been
in part carried out in the Model Tenements
in New York, but variations and improvements
are needed. There should be more
light and air, more grass and trees, even if
the buildings are fifteen-story towers.</p>

<p>The old story has been so often reiterated,
&#8220;But the tenants will not use the
devices,&#8221; that the capitalist has become callous
to this appeal. The missing link in
the chain has been the instruction to go with
the construction.</p>

<p>All department stores, all venders of
new mechanical appliances, have come to
recognize the value of demonstration, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
instruction, in the use of articles as an aid
to purchase. The advocate of better dwellings
must take a leaf from the commercial
book and <i>show how</i>. It is in this that philanthropy
has been weak in the past. It
has assumed a power to see, where there
was only a fear of handling the strange
objects.</p>

<p>There is a virgin field for the capitalist
who wishes to use some millions for the
prosperity of the country to build a short
trolley line to a district of sanitary houses
with gardens, playgrounds, entertainment
halls, etc.; such a village to contain, not
long blocks, but both separate houses and
tenements from two rooms up, possibly
several stories high, where the elders may
have light and air without the confusion of
the street. Dust and noise will be eliminated.
There should be a central bakery
and laundry, and, most important of all,
an office where both men and women skilled
in sanitary and economic practical affairs
may be found ready to go to any home and
advise on any subject. There has never yet
been such an enterprise with all the elements<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
worked out. Several, however, have
shown the way, the Morris houses in Brooklyn,
for example.</p>

<p>It is easier to take a city block and construct
fireproof, high buildings than to solve
transportation problems. We are losing
our fear of the high buildings as we see
the great value of light and air. There is
chance for work in this direction, for in
spite of rapid transit some must live in the
center of things.</p>

<p>Let a philanthropist or two, instead of
building hospitals, set some bright young
architects and sanitarians to devising such
suitable housing conditions for city and
suburbs as will obviate the necessity for
hospitals. Any lover of his kind, any one
who longs for fame, could find both it and
the blessing of the homeless by this means,
and in the end get a fair return for his
investment.</p>

<p>The Federal Department of Labor<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> has
studied workingmen&#8217;s houses, but <i>living
in the house</i> has not been worked up.
The housewife has no station to which she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>may carry her trials, like the experiment
stations which have been provided for the
farmer. Here is another opportunity for
the capitalist to hasten the time when the
State will supply these. The way will very
soon be laid out and the first steps taken.</p>

<p>For the immediate present some standard
of healthful housing is needed, and now
that a similar type of house and of apartment
house is being built in all cities and
towns from one ocean to the other, and from
Texas to Maine, such a standard is compatible
with conditions.</p>

<p>A score card for houses to rent would
save much wrangling. The agent shows the
card with this house&#8217;s rating, and the tenant
learns that some of his wishes are incompatible
with the standard, and some would
mean a much higher rent than he is willing
to pay. Professor J.&nbsp;R. Commons, Department
of Economics, University of Wisconsin,
has devised a score card to serve the
house hunter and householder as a standard
of comparison. This should serve the house
builder as well, indicating what the demand
will be forty or fifty years hence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>At present the rating stands somewhat as
follows:</p>


<ul style="line-height: 130%">
<li style="padding-left: 6em">Dwelling, 100 points</li>

<p>A score card movement might be started
as a hobby, and in the end lead public
opinion to judicial choice and action. No
such movement, however, is possible without
leaders, and leaders of the right type.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>The lesson for the community to be
drawn from a study of crowd psychology
is that of leadership and loyal co&ouml;peration.
The common man is likely to be possessed
of one idea at a time. If such an one becomes
a leader, there is danger that equally
vital factors will be overlooked. Safety is
found in a combination of leaders to make
an all-round improvement.</p>

<p>Each individual is too busy in his own
affairs to look after his own, much less his
neighbor&#8217;s, health and comfort, hence community
life, with its advantages, brings its
own dangers. Children in school in contact
with other children; crowds in trains, in elevators,
stores, in lecture halls, contract habits
as well as diseases. The need for large
quantities of supplies at one point brings
long-distance transportation and cold storage
difficulties. The man who caters to
public need does not look far ahead to consequences,
and if unrestrained may prove
more of a menace than a convenience.</p>

<p>The safe and reasonable way is to delegate
to certain persons the making and enforcement
of regulations corresponding to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the needs of the times, and then to obey
them, even at some personal inconvenience.</p>

<p>Each community should put into the
hands of its health officers the carrying out
of the rules it has agreed to as an <i>insurance</i>
against outbreaks of disease. Does a man
let his fire insurance policy lapse because
the year has passed without a fire? Even
if the regulation seems superfluous to the
particular individual or family, let it be
remembered that there are inflammable
spots in every community. Eternal vigilance
is the price of safety in sanitary as
well as in military affairs. As in the army,
the community must delegate scout duty to
certain chosen individuals and rely on their
report for safety.</p>

<h3>FAITH AND HOPE</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">P</span>rogress</span> is a series of zigzags: now
the individual goes ahead of the community;
now the community outstrips the
individual.</p>

<p>The community cannot rise much above
the level of the individual home, and the
home rises only by the pull of the community
regulations, or by the initiative of a few
especially farsighted individuals.</p>

<p>The steps need to be carefully measured,
for if the family begins to rely on the State
for the backbone it should have, it will not
stay up, and its fall will be lower than the
stage it rose from. &#8220;When man reverts, he
goes not to Nature, but to death.&#8221;</p>

<p>The example set by the city in maintaining
clean streets and well-kept parks reacts
upon the home yards. The insistence by the
police on city regulations as to alleys and
garbage educates the family as to the general
attention to be paid to such things.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>The city authorities, on the other hand,
are prodded to their work by well-informed
individuals who see the great gain to the
community from certain measures.</p>

<p>The centers of movement, civic and
quasi-religious or philanthropic, are usually
the outgrowth of individual effort. The
great movements for betterment&mdash;water
supply, street cleaning, tenement laws, etc.&mdash;are
carried out by community agreement
with a common tax outlay.</p>

<p>The clean city means streets of clean
houses. The clean house in the midst of a
dirty city may be the match to start a fire of
cleansing.</p>

<p>Probably medical inspection in the public
school is as good an example as may
be given of helpfulness to the community.
No quicker means of influencing both home
and community life may be found, for in
five years it might revolutionize the whole.</p>

<p>School buildings should be so constructed
and so managed that they cannot
themselves either produce or aggravate
physical defects. Departments of school
hygiene should be organized, not only in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
every city, but for every rural school under
county and state superintendents of instruction.
The general question of physical
welfare of children involves too many considerations
to be satisfactorily treated by
school physician and school nurse alone, or
by busy teachers and principals.</p>

<p>&#8220;New York City will spend in 1910
$6,500 for making over twenty rooms in
regular buildings, a first step in an entirely
new plan of ventilation, which will eventually
give outdoor air to all children, sick
or well.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Speaking generally, America is one of
the last of the civilized nations to deal with
the subject of the medical inspection of
school children upon a comprehensive and
national scheme. But once aroused to the
needs, it is safe to say that the nation will
speedily educate parents to correct such
home conditions as reduce the child&#8217;s ability
to profit from schooling, and to persuade
governments to see that safe homes are provided.
It will be easy to convince the taxpayer
that it is cheaper to provide such care
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>than to neglect the future parent and citizen,
for it is easy to prove that medical
inspection in our schools returns large dividends
on small investments. Dr. Luther
Gulick says that it seems probable, though
only a guess, that the total annual expenditure
for medical inspection of schools in the
United States at the present time is perhaps
$500,000. The money saved by enabling
thousands of children to do one year&#8217;s work
in one year, instead of in two or three years,
would greatly exceed the total expense of
examining all children in all boroughs.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The health of all our school children
should be conserved by a system of competent
medical inspection which should secure
the correction of defects of eyes, ears,
teeth, as well as defects due to infection or
malnutrition.</p>

<p>The statistics of medical inspection in
public schools tell a pitiful tale wherever
it has been tried: thirty or forty per cent of
the children are found with defective or
diseased eyes, ten to twenty per cent with
distorted spines, fifteen per cent with throat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>and nose troubles, all of which directly
affect their intellectual proficiency.</p>

<p>When these deficiencies are discovered
and reported to the parents, such is the
apathy of disbelief that seventy-five per
cent of the cases usually go unattended;
therefore the school nurse, who follows the
case home and explains the needs and sets
forth the penalties, has become a necessity.</p>

<p>The parent who permits his child to go
to school physically unfitted to profit from
school opportunity is not only injuring his
own child, but is injuring his neighbor&#8217;s
child, and is taxing that neighbor without
the latter&#8217;s consent.</p>

<p>It would seem as if such parents had
forfeited their right to the sole care of the
children, and that government would be
obliged, for its own protection, to step in
and do the work while it is needed. The
author has termed this <i>temporary paternalism</i>.
The providing of penny lunches during
the morning recess, the service of the
school nurse and the home visitor to teach
those parents who are willing to learn all
these schemes for the saving of the child,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
may be carried out in a spirit of helpfulness
with a support which may be withdrawn
when no longer needed.</p>

<p>Although all America has not become
aroused to the undoubted fact of tendencies
toward physical deterioration, it is on the
verge of an awakening. The public school
is the natural medium for the spread of
better ideals, and if the teachers of cooking
and of hygiene would co&ouml;perate and use all
the material which sanitary science is heaping
on the table before them, we should
soon see a betterment of the physical status.
Combined with medical inspection and
sanitary construction of schoolhouses, this
would raise the general health of the community
thirty or forty per cent in five years
and fifty to seventy per cent in ten years.</p>

<p>There has been in some quarters much
objection to public effort towards remedying
evils which would not have existed if
each family had lived up to its duties. The
community is a larger family, with greater
resources, and can employ investigators to
find the means for greater security. That
individual is very foolish who does not recognize<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
this interaction between community
and individual, and who objects to taking
the benefits of the larger knowledge.</p>

<p>To take one of the latest examples of
social problems: In every thousand children
in the public schools of any city, probably of
the town also, there are perhaps fifty who
are ill-nourished (not necessarily underfed),
ill-clothed, unwashed, and deprived
of good air for sleeping. What is the duty
of the public? This is one of the burning
questions of the moment. Send missionary
teachers to the homes, some say, but that is
costly; the selection of the suitable missionary
is difficult, and the result may be slight.
Others say, give one good luncheon at the
school, for which the children pay in part
or in whole, and make that an education
which, by the aid of the school nurse, will
in time affect a change in habit. In short,
the problem is this: Shall the children suffer
in childhood and become a burden on society
in adult years, or shall society protect
itself from future expense by community
care now? &#8220;Because <i>finding</i> diseases and
defects does not protect children unless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
discovery is followed by <i>treatment</i>, fifty-eight
cities take children to dispensaries
or instruct at schoolhouses; fifty-eight send
nurses from house to house to instruct parents
and to persuade them to have their
families cared for; 101 send out cards of
instruction to parents either by mail or the
children; while 157 cities have arranged
special co&ouml;peration with dispensaries, hospitals,
and relief societies for giving the
children the shoes or clothing or medical
and dental care which is found necessary.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Nearly all preventive measures adopted
by society and ranked as paternalism by
timid philanthropists are or may be educative
and temporary at the same time.
They may be dropped as soon as the end is
gained. The attention of parents must be
called to neglected duties. Compulsory
attention to such duties as affect the wards
of society, the children, may be needed for
a time. Just as the wise father, taking the
child for a walk, allows him to run free as
soon as his strength and courage permit, so
the paternalism of society is relaxed as soon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>as its <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;es</i> show themselves both able
and willing to do the right thing without its
aid or command.</p>

<p>Compulsory school attendance places responsibility
for certain care, vaccination,
decent clothing, good food, decent shelter.
The thousand and one ways in which society
is now protecting itself are all educating
the newcomers to American ideals. They
are all intended to make efficient, self-sustaining
citizens who do not feel the pull of
the law or the bond of outside care. It
is the last conflict between the ideals of individualism
and those of the community need,
subordinating the individual preference.
Much wisdom and forbearance will be
needed to secure this community ideal, but
in that way evidently lies progress. It behooves
the leaders of social effort to make
all their work educational, and thus remove
the necessity for a repetition in the future.</p>

<p>Just as the parent in the home establishes
habits while the child&#8217;s mind is plastic,
so the community stands <i>in loco parentis</i>
to the future citizen, and surrounds him
with safeguards while needed. Knowledge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
is needed, scientific investigation is fundamental,
expert wisdom is indispensable,
costly though it is, being the product of
long research and rare brain power. This
is at the service of the nation for the good
of all the people, and it is the surer the
wider the range of experience. For this
reason chiefly, greater actual knowledge
and more complete harmonizing of conflicting
interests is necessary. Certain sanitary
measures are carried out by the Federal
government as an education to communities,
just as communities educate individuals.
Federal effort may be unwisely put forth in
certain cases, investigations of little consequence
may be undertaken, but on the whole
a democracy must learn to manage its affairs
by making mistakes. The principle should
not be discarded as a result of the first
mistake.</p>

<p>The immediate concern of this chapter
is with the leaders of community movements,
the educated, sympathetic, farsighted
sociologists, sanitarians, and economists,
whose concern is for the advancement
of mankind. These leaders must have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
courage and belief in the value of their
work, for no half-hearted means will carry
the community forward. Still more, they
must have knowledge, a sure ground to stand
upon. To acquire this means both time and
opportunity. To go into betterment work
without it is to set back the wheels of progress,
not to advance them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>When human beings and families rationally subordinate their own
interests as perfectly to the welfare of future generations as do animals
under the control of instinct, the world will have a more enduring type
of family life than exists at present. This can only be accomplished by
the development of controlling ideals which are supported not only by
reason and intelligence but by ethical impulse and religious motive.</p>

<p>The home should be considered the place where are to be developed
and conveyed the precious qualities which are so vital to the continuity of
the race and the progress of human society and civilization.</p>

<p>Those factors which are of a more material or physical nature, such
as shelter, food, dress, and personal health, are to be estimated in their
relation to mind, character, and effective conduct.</p>

<p>In the confusion of relative values human health as one of the essential
means to many worthy ends is usually neglected. Man is the most highly
developed of all species of animals. He is, to some degree at least, civilized,
and yet human beings are of all animals the sickliest, and this in
spite of the fact that human health is more important to man and to the
world than the health of any other creature. And by health I do not
mean simply existence, freedom from pain, or absence of disease, but
rather organic power and efficiency, the maximum vital ability possible to
the individual for the doing of all that seems most worth while in life.</p>

<h3>RESPONSIBILITY</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> ideal of &#8220;home&#8221; is protection
from dangers from <i>within</i>&mdash;bad
habits, bad food, bad air, dirt and abuse,&mdash;shelter,
in fact, from all stunting agencies,
just as the gardener protects his tender
plants until they become strong enough to
stand by themselves. The child&#8217;s home
environment is certainly a potent factor in
his future efficiency.</p>

<p>But more than physical protection is
that education in all that goes to make up
profitable living, acquired by following the
mother or nurse in her daily round and in
having legitimate questions answered. Imitation
is the first step in good habits, as in
learning to walk or to read. That which
is set before the child should be worthy its
imitation, and be of value when fixed as a
habit. Habits of health, correct position,
deep breathing, clean ways, distaste for
dirt in one&#8217;s person or in one&#8217;s vicinity, liking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
for fresh air, for simple food, good
habits of exercise, of reading, and the thousand
and one trifles that go to make up the
efficient worker in adult years, all belong
to the well-ordered home, where, as one
author puts it, the child is the business of
the day.</p>

<p>But the State cannot risk its property
too far.</p>

<p>When mothers become so careless or
ignorant that half their children fail to
reach their first birthday, and of those that
live to be three years old a majority are
defrauded of their birthright of health,
some agency must step in.</p>

<p>If the State is to have good citizens it
must provide for the teaching of the essentials
to a generation that will become the
wiser mothers and fathers of the next.
Therefore, even if we regard this as only
a temporary expedient, we must begin to
teach the children in our schools, and begin
at once, that which we see they are no
longer learning in the home. &#8220;The achievement
at Huddersfield, England, is especially
noteworthy. The average annual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
number of deaths of infants for ten years
had been 310. By a systematic education
of mothers the number was in 1907 reduced
to 212. The cost of saving these ninety-eight
lives was about $2,000.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>One university has established a course
in the care of children, much to the amusement
of the press. The United States Commissioner
of Education has, however, been
a responsible mover in the idea.</p>

<p>But real progress by means of family
education means the stable family and the
permanent dwelling. Where is the family
in the permanent dwelling today? Among
any class, except the agricultural, where is
the stable family?</p>

<p>Since industry has taken woman&#8217;s work
from her, and she has to follow it out into
the world, the means of education for the
child has gone from the home. Its atmosphere
is artificial, if the attempt is made.</p>

<p>To work exclusively on the family, for
the sake of the child, is a very slow process.
As in all American life, the quicker method
appeals most strongly. The school is today
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>the quickest means of reaching both child
and home; the present home through the
child, and the future homes through the
children when they grow up.</p>

<p>And time presses! A whole generation
has been lost because the machine ran wild
without guidance, and all attempt at improvement
was met by futile resistance.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to present the socionomist&#8217;s
view of the child in the home so
that it may appeal to the two extremes of
opinion. There are those who still apply
medi&aelig;val rules to twentieth century living;
those who believe, honestly, that the
ideal life was found in the days when the
mother was the manufacturer in her own
home and the children were her helpers in
all the varied processes. &#8220;There was never
any artificial teaching devised so good for
children as the daily helping in the household
tasks.&#8221; The inference is made that
therefore the same restriction for the mother
and the children leads to an ideal life today.
Such persons fail to realize that the twentieth
century is practically a new world. The
old rules which related to material things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
hardly hold more closely than they would
on the planet Mars. The fundamental
moral principles of reverence, obedience,
love, and unselfish sacrifice must be worked
in on a new background.</p>

<p>To keep the eighteenth century habit,
so carefully taught the girl, of courtesying
as she stepped aside to allow the rider or
the ox cart to pass, in these days of the
swift automobile, which would be out of
sight before the knee could bend, is no
more ridiculous than to expect the average
young mother to follow the methods of her
grandmother. Her mother&#8217;s ways are now
pronounced all wrong, not necessarily because
they were wrong then, but because
conditions have changed, knowledge has
been gained, and it is clearly a waste of
human life, of money, of physical and
mental power for people to be sick and die
because the caretaker does not use the

<p>If the young mother can learn how
better to fulfill her duties by going out of
the house to lectures or classes, why not?</p>

<p>Tracts are not always successful as an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
incentive to conduct. It is obviously impossible
to pass a blue law compelling
parents to conform to&mdash;what ideal? The
school is fast taking the place of the home,
not because it wishes to do so, but because
the home does not fulfill its function, and
so far has not been made to, and the lack
must be supplied. The personal point of
view, inculcated now by modern conditions
of strife for money, just as surely as it must
have been by barbarian struggle in pre-civilized
days, must be supplanted by the
broad view of majority welfare. The
extreme of the personal point of view,
expressed in such phrases as &#8220;The world
owes me a living;&#8221; &#8220;My child is mine to
treat as I please;&#8221; &#8220;It is nobody&#8217;s business
how I spend my money;&#8221; &#8220;I have a right
to all the pleasure I can get out of life,&#8221; is
well shown in Mr. H.&nbsp;G. Wells&#8217;s analogy<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>:
&#8220;A cat&#8217;s standpoint is probably strictly individualistic.
She sees the whole universe as a
scheme of more or less useful, pleasurable,
and interesting things concentrated upon
her sensitive and interesting personality.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>With a sinuous determination she evades
disagreeables and pursues delights. Life
is to her quite clearly and simply a succession
of pleasures, sensations, and interests,
among which interests there happen to be&mdash;kittens.&#8221;</p>

<p>This unsuspicious ignorance of the real
nature of life is by no means confined to
animals and savages; it would seem to be
the common view of many young people
today. At least they take as little care of
the homes to which they bring children,
and they follow the cat&#8217;s example in boxing
the children&#8217;s ears and turning them out to
fend for themselves.</p>

<p>The last generation seemed to become
disciples of Schopenhauer in his passionate
rebellion against the fate that deferred all
the pleasure of the present to the needs of
the future generation. Evolution has revealed
the necessity for this subordination
of the individual lot to the destiny of the
race, if progress is to be made. The man
who asserts himself as free from race trammels
is snuffed out as a factor&mdash;a blighted
blossom fallen to earth and trodden under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
foot. To the student of biological evolution,
the individual is as a mere pin point
on the chart of community advance, for
surely society grows according to evolutionary
law. &#8220;As certainly as Nature gives
the poor child its chance of a good life,
so certainly do the circumstances of slum
environment rob it forthwith of its birthright&mdash;it
is not uncommon to find more
than half the children of three years of age
hanging on to life with marks of disease
and undergrowth firmly implanted on their
tender frames. Yet, practically, none of this
is inherited in the true sense; it is the victory
of evil human devices in their endeavor
to cheat Nature of her own. If ever there
was a mission in the world worthy of the
most strenuous service, it is to wrest back
this victory, be it out of pity for suffering
children or for the very welfare and existence
of the nation.</p>

<p>&#8220;The schools have made their beginning;
the <i>homes</i> have not yet started; they
wait the impulse from without. It is for
voluntary, intelligent opinion to get to work
on the home, and never to relax until a race<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of parents has arisen which knows no other
duty to the state than to rear with heart and
brain the children which have been given
to them. Then we shall hear no more about
physical degeneracy.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Hope for the future is to be found in
the conclusions of the immigration commission,
that in one generation certain marked
changes in stature and in head measurements
have taken place in the children of
immigrants of various nationalities, such
changes as have hitherto been considered as
the result of centuries. The commissioners
credit the better environment and larger
opportunities with these indications of increasing
intellectuality and mental force.</p>

<p>Most human efficiency is the result of
habits rather than of innate ability. These
habits of mind, as well as of body, are developed
by the home life at an early age.
The home is responsible for the upbringing
of healthy, intelligent children. Here is the
place for fostering the valuable and suppressing
the harmful traits. The school can
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>never take the place of the home in this.
With the large classes of the public schools,
the teacher should not be asked to undertake
this individual work. Moreover, correcting
a child for personal habits can
hardly be effective before fifty or sixty pairs
of critical eyes.</p>

<p>The office of the home must be to teach
habits of right living and daily action, and
a joy and pride in life as well as responsibility
for life. It is not fair that the parents
should sit back and shift to the school the
whole responsibility for the future citizen.</p>

<p>The little modifications can best be made
in the home, permanent foundations can be
laid and braced with habits so good and
strong that nothing can shake them. Most
powers are the result of habits. Let the
furrows be plowed deeply enough while the
brain cells are plastic, then human energies
will result in efficiency and the line of least
resistance will be the right line. Everything,
therefore, which influences the child
must be the best known to science. The
houses of the land must be regulated by the
scientific laws of right living. To the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
woman, the home worker, we say: &#8220;You
must have the will power, for the sake of
your child, to bring to his service all that
has been discovered for the promotion of
human efficiency, so that he may have the
habit, the <i>technique</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>To pay a tax today for the benefit of
one&#8217;s children is a principle of insurance,
of benefit association. This feeling of
obligation means present sacrifice of ease
and inclination, and it has been increasingly
shirked, so that it is not surprising that a
tax to insure one against future loss by disease
is an unwelcome proposition.</p>

<p>The whole question of the child in the
home is one of ethics, as the writers on
social conditions have been trying to convince
the world. If the swarms of dwellers
in the busy hives of industry have no sense
of their humanity, if they do not use the
human power of looking ahead, that power
which differentiates man from animals,
what better are they than animals?</p>

<p>No one can be sorry that there are no
children in thousands of homes one knows.
It is better that children should not have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
been born than to come into an inheritance
of suffering and mental and moral dwarfing.
Social uplift will not be possible while
parents take the view of cats, or even of a
well-to-do mother who said, &#8220;I did not
have my baby to discipline her; I had her
to play with.&#8221;</p>

<p>No state can thrive while its citizens
waste their resources of health, bodily
energy, time, and brain power, any more
than a nation may prosper which wastes its
natural resources.</p>

<p>America today is wasting its human
possibilities even more prodigally than its
material wealth. The latter deficiency is
being brought to a halt. Shall the human
side receive less attention? A sharply
divided line between home and school is
no longer clearly drawn. Parents&#8217; associations
are being formed and are co&ouml;perating
with the school-teacher. To what end? To
the better moral and intellectual atmosphere
of the home. Physical education has had
its vogue, but too much as an endeavor
apart, not as a necessary element in the
whole.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>The pedagogical world is now becoming
convinced that physical defects are more
often than not the basis of mental incompetence,
and this leads logically to the teaching
of the laws of right living in a practical
way, not merely as lessons from books, but
as daily practice. This practice must eventually
go into the home, where the most of
the child&#8217;s hours are spent. It is as useless
to expect good health from unsanitary
houses as good English from two hours&#8217;
school training diluted by twelve hours of
slovenly language. Hence the imperative
need of such teaching and example as can
be put into practice; and since immediate
house to house renovation and change of
view are impossible, the school must provide
for teaching how to live wisely and
sanely, as well as for clear thinking and
&aelig;sthetic appreciation. Practical hygiene,
food, cleanliness, sanitation, all must eventually
be exemplified by the schoolhouse
and taught as a part of a general education
to all pupils, boys and girls.</p>

<p>If this sounds like socialism, let us not
be afraid, but educate for five or ten years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
all children, so that homes may be better
managed, and then it is to be hoped there
will be no need for such school training.
To live economically in the broad sense of
wise use of time, money, and bodily strength
is the great need of the twentieth century.
This is practical economics. This is something
which cannot today, except in rare
instances, be learned at home, for conditions
change so rapidly that grown people
may not keep up with them. Mothers&#8217;
ways are superseded before the children
are grown.</p>

<p>The school, if it is maintained as a progressive
institution and a defense against
predatory ideas, is the people&#8217;s safeguard
from being crushed by the irresistible car
of progress. I repeat, standards may be set
by the school which will reach and influence
the community in a few months. Such
standards should be a means of safeguarding
the people, and this leads to the most
important service which a teacher of domestic
economy can render to the people
in giving them a sense of control over their
environment, than which nothing is so
conducive to stability of ideas.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>To feel one&#8217;s self in command of a situation
robs it of its terror. A great danger
in America today is the loss of this feeling
of self-confidence with which the pioneer
was abundantly furnished. A certain helpless
dependence is creeping over the land
because of the peculiar development of resources,
which must be replaced by a sense
of power over one&#8217;s environment.</p>

in life&mdash;of any purpose, at least, beyond purely material ones. To those

whether in society, business, or elsewhere, their gospel drives them to all
means within the law to attain that. To those who have both money

<h3>THE HOME AND THE SCHOOL</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">O</span>ne</span> must not displace the other, for
one cannot replace the other, but
rather the home and the school must react
on each other. The home is the place in
which to gain the experience, and the
school the place in which to acquire the
knowledge that shall illuminate and crystallize
the experience. The child should
go out to the school with enthusiasm, and
return to the home filled with a deeper interest
and desire to realize things.</p>

<p>In morals and manners the school can
only give tendency or direction to the child&#8217;s
life. The school is not the best place to
teach ethics. In the family life the child
himself finds his future revealed, reflected
by his relations to other members of the
family. The spirit of co&ouml;peration nurtured
there will develop in the school through
the more various opportunities of relationship
to others.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>The earlier conditions cannot be restored,
even the home training cannot be
brought back, except on the farm, and there,
it is hoped, it may be revived. The city or
suburban children cannot have the opportunity
to pick up chips when too young to
bring in wood; cannot stand by and hold
skeins of yarn, or go to the barn and help
feed the calves&mdash;all most interesting and
provocative of endless questions. They cannot
go into the garden and pick berries or
vegetables for dinner, cannot learn how to
avoid breaking the vines, or how to judge
the ripeness of the melons.</p>

<p>All that is probably not feasible for
many, because it is not possible to give
children of this age responsibility without
oversight, and today&#8217;s elders are loath to
give and are often incapable of giving
oversight.</p>

<p>But while these circumstances over
which, apparently, we have no control,
preclude much of the valuable outdoor
work, food has still to be prepared, dishes
need washing, and clothes must be mended,
even if towels and napkins are no longer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
hemmed by hand. Rooms are still swept
and dusted, beds are made, and chairs and
tables put straight. Has any better means
of giving experience ever been devised than
these small, daily tasks which differentiate
men from animals? The care of the fixed
habitation, the foresight needed to prepare
the things for the family life in the weeks
and months to come, the co&ouml;peration of
all the members of the family toward one
common end&mdash;all tend toward high <i>human
ideals</i>. If the wise mother only realized
the value to the child of helping in such
portions as are not too heavy, of being a
part of the life, she would let nothing stand
in the way of using this natural means of
development. But with foreign domestics
whose idea is to get the various duties over
as soon as possible, and whose gift is not
that of teaching, how is the child to grow
into the normal ways of right daily living,
unconsciously and effectively?</p>

<p>If the parents continue to throw all the
work of education on the school, then the
school must take the best means of fulfilling
the task.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Not only has the home put the burden
of education on the school, but the school
has drawn the child away from the home.
The school of today demands much more
from him than the school of the early New
England days. It has taken the time that
was formerly given to assisting in the duties
of the household; it has taken from the
home the interest and responsibility that
were developed through the co&ouml;peration in
the family life. School has taken the place
of home in the child&#8217;s thoughts. In the
morning the thought is of reaching school
in time, not of the home duties whose performance
could lighten many a mother&#8217;s
burden.</p>

<p>The school, hurried with a curriculum
that is wasteful of time and energy, lacking
correlation in the studies (except in a few
schools that are noted exceptions proving
the rule), has little time to relate its work to
the home as the kindergarten does in its
morning talk; so there must come an intermediate
step in order that the school may
emphasize the home life and industries, and
that a generation may grow up who shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
have a knowledge of the daily needs of
life.</p>

<p>The interest awakened in the school will
surely react upon the home. It is like an
expedition going out to make discoveries
and to bring back knowledge to its own land.
The directive work of the school will thus
become a practical realization in the home.
Then the cycle will be complete, for while
the school has separated the child from
his natural environment for many hours
and weeks, it is sending him back better
equipped through knowledge and experience
to fulfill his place there.</p>

<p>How shall the ends be gained artificially
by devices of the school? For gained they
must be, if civilization is to be maintained.</p>

<p>To quote from Isabel Bevier:</p>

<p>&#8220;As the home is so inseparably connected
with the house, and our comfort and
efficiency are so greatly influenced by the
kind of houses in which we live, much of
interest and importance centers in the study
of the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moreover, with the house, its evolution,
decoration, and care, may be associated much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
that is interesting in history, art, and architecture,
as well as much that has a direct
bearing on the daily life of the individual.</p>

<p>The philosophers have struggled for
centuries, each contributing according to
his experience and vision to determine what
is the purpose of life. America&#8217;s thought
could be translated into the word efficiency.
Yes, we might almost say she worships efficiency.
If, then, efficiency is to be the goal,
what are the means to develop it? Efficiency
depends chiefly upon good health,
and to maintain this we must first consider
in the scheme of education the physical
aids&mdash;food, air, water, clothing and shelter,
exercise and rest&mdash;and with this goal in
view must come also recreation, play or
amusement, and beauty to develop the
mental and the spiritual. In relating our
scheme of work to this ideal we will consider
first the shelter.</p>

<p>The children of ten or twelve years of
age have passed the &#8220;make-believe&#8221; stage
of play; they want the &#8220;real,&#8221; but of their
own kind and age. After little children
have made and played with toys and foreshadowed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the needs of the actual home,
the time has come for the youth to have his
demands, which are not yet the demands of
man and manhood.</p>

<p>At the Tuberculosis Congress, held in
Washington in 1908, a sanatorium in England,
which won a prize, presented among
many good features a system of graded work
with graded tools, almost childlike implements
for the weak and unskilled, gradually
advancing toward the normal as the strength
and health of the man grew. So it should
be with the material we should give to the
children.</p>

<p>After the toy age a house about two-thirds
the ordinary sized house may be
constructed. A room seven feet square is
very livable for a child. Three rooms is a
very good working plant&mdash;the kitchen and
the bedroom, the dining and living room
combined. Both boys and girls may co&ouml;perate
in planning, building, and furnishing
this home.</p>

<p>The plan of a modern house may be
drawn, basing it on the knowledge of house
architecture through history, of the modification<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
necessary to site through geography,
and the knowledge that science has brought
of drainage, ventilation, and construction.
The house could be built by the manual
training class, or if that is not feasible it
may be built by one of the firms making
portable houses. At all events, it can be
painted by the children, and this will lead
to lessons on color, the use of paint and its
composition.</p>

<p>While the &#8220;shelter&#8221; is being constructed
the child must be considering at the same
time the principles of caring for the
home, for this would naturally influence
the thought of furnishing. The simply
furnished home means less physical exertion,
but not less beauty. The home planned
and executed on scientific principles of
hygiene and sanitation means a healthful
home, a much cleaner home.</p>

<p>The shelter of the individual has been
considered; now comes the immediate protection
of the child&mdash;its clothing. It would
not be quite practical in this little home to
enter into the personal activities of bathing
and dressing. A very large doll, approximating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the child, may be used, one large
enough so that it can wear boots, stockings,
etc., that are usually bought for the real
child. Here can be taught also the lesson
in wise spending.</p>

<p>The right care of the body must be included
among the necessities of education.
The teaching of the principles of hygiene
should be closely related to the lives of the
children. Correct habits, not rules, are
the proper prevention for all sorts of defects.
To secure and maintain a healthy
body, habits of cleanliness and enthusiasm
for health must be inculcated. Such habits
can be readily impressed on the body while
it is plastic&mdash;that is, while it is young;
but they are acquired only with difficulty
and by much thought in after years. Hence
there is the greatest economy of time and
energy in accustoming young people to
habits of daily living which will give them
the best chance in after life&mdash;the chance
to be &#8220;healthy, happy, efficient human
beings.&#8221; Most of the teaching must be by
indirect methods&mdash;illustrations&mdash;and so
the doll may be used again to demonstrate
and relate facts about the daily life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>An old Scotch writer once said, &#8220;He that
would be good must be happy, and he that
would be happy must be healthy.&#8221; As has
already been said, the great increase of disease
from causes under individual control,
such as that which is brought on by errors
of diet, points to a need for a more general
education in this respect. The food problem
is fundamental to the welfare of the
race. Society, to protect itself, must take
cognizance of the questions of food and
nutrition. It is necessary to give the child
the right ideas on these subjects, for only
then will there be sufficient effort to get the
right kind of food and to have it clean.
Right living goes further and demands the
right manner of serving and eating the food.
The home table should be the school of
good manners and of good food habits of
which the child ought not to be deprived.</p>

<p>If all the foregoing principles have been
developed, if the child has been led to see
the joy of living through these home activities,
he will consider the home the true
shelter, the place where he can have the
happiest play, the easiest rest, where he can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
study most earnestly, and express himself
most honestly.</p>

<p>And the parents, the fathers and mothers
of children of the city? How far are we
helping the city dwellers to take advantage
of city life? The principles back of housekeeping
are the same, the end the same&mdash;what
are to be the means to stimulate the
modern home-maker? Show the possibilities
within reach of them; send the children
home with ideas which the mother must
consider.</p>

<p>Education in pursuing the so-called
&#8220;humanities&#8221; has been holding up to view
a hypothetical man in a hypothetical environment.</p>

<p>The pursuit of gold has not been hindered
thereby, and has gone on without the
restraints of education because of the complete
detachment of ideals inculcated from
the actual daily life where money meant
personal pleasure and comfort for the time
being.</p>

<p>The power over things gained by a few
students was utilized by money power to
hasten all progress. Speed was the watchword.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
No one could stop to see what injury
he had caused. &#8220;Get there,&#8221; really seemed
to be the motto. In this scramble for power
the &#8220;purpose&#8221; for which life is lived has
been lost sight of. No &#8220;worthy aim&#8221; has
been impressed on the mind of the child.</p>

<p>An awakening has come and the school
is the leading factor in the upward movement.
Education is coming to have a new
meaning, or better, perhaps, is going back to
the older meaning with new materials. No
knowledge or power the youth may acquire
will avail in real struggle for existence of
the race without a definite aim to hold
steady the eye fixed on a certain goal. This
is a law of man&#8217;s existence.</p>

<p>The change in point of view has been
growing like a root underground. It seems
to have suddenly sent up shoots in every
direction. In no line of thought has this
change come more generally than in relation
to the things youth should be taught.
Himself and his relation to his environment
are now to the front. Instead of extolling
man as the lord of all created things,
the youth is made to see that man unaided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
by scientific knowledge is at the mercy of
Nature&#8217;s forces; that man in crowds is sure
to succumb unless he makes a strong effort
to keep himself erect.</p>

<p>Hence the boys are given manual training&mdash;power
over wood and stone, steam
and electricity; and are taught the principles
of production of food and metals.
The girls are being taught to distinguish
values in textiles and food stuffs; to manage
finances and to keep houses in a sanitary
manner.</p>

<p>It is the business of the higher education
at once to apply the knowledge of
preventive measures to its own students and
through them to reach the people, but it has
been very slow to take up the cause of better
environment.</p>

<p>In colleges there is still more emphasis
laid on external works, such as water supply,
drainage, etc., than on the more intimate
hourly needs of fresh air and clean
rooms. The halls, study rooms, and dining
rooms of colleges are notoriously ill ventilated
and not over clean.</p>

<p>The senses are blunted at an age when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
they should be keenly sensitive. It is only
within ten years or so that very many of
the higher schools have made a point of
indoor sanitation beyond plumbing provisions.
Outdoor sports have been relied
upon to give sufficient impetus to the health
side of education.</p>

<p>A new element has come into the State
universities through the Home Economics
courses, which have been steadily growing
in favor during the last two decades.
Within that time several buildings have
been erected and equipped to teach the principles
of sanitary and economic living both
in institution, school, and family life.</p>

<p>Probably no one movement has been so
powerful as this in convincing educators
of the efficiency of trained women as factors
in sanitary progress. In no other direction
is the outlook for social service greater.
The woman must, however, be more than a
willing worker; she must be educated in
science as a foundation for sanitary work.</p>

<p>Within the next few years the demand
for trained women is sure far to exceed the
supply, for the fundamental sciences are
not to be acquired in one or two years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Young college women are even now
realizing their mistake in neglecting the
sciences. They assumed that science was
not of practical use. They assumed that
educational curricula were stable and would
go on in the same lines forever.</p>

<p>The high school is now fully awake to
these vital factors. Some of the best buildings
in the United States are the high school
buildings, those of the West excelling those
of the East. By 1911 nearly every school
will have a course in Sanitary Science. It
may be under the name of Home Economics,
or of Camp Cookery, or of House
Building, but the idea of better physical
environment has already taken root. In
the extension of school work by the employment
of the school visitor to supplement
the work of the teacher in the grade
schools, in Parents&#8217; Associations, in Mothers&#8217;
Clubs, in social endeavors on every side,
there is coming the study of more special
branches of sanitary science, clean air, clean
floors, clean clothes&mdash;where once cooking
lessons were the extent to which the workers
could lead.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Evolution has at last been accepted as
applying to man as well as to animals. In
his inaugural address, November, 1909,
President H.&nbsp;J. Waters, of Kansas Agricultural
College, said: &#8220;... for every dollar
that goes into the fitting of a show herd
of cattle or hogs, or into experiments in
feeding domestic animals, there should be
a like sum available for fundamental research
in feeding men for the greatest
efficiency.... We have millions for research
in the realm of domestic animals and nothing
for the application of science to the
rearing of children.&#8221;</p>

<p>Evidence is not wanting that all this is
to be speedily changed. Man has awakened
to the fact that he is &#8220;the sickest beast alive&#8221;
and that he has himself to blame, and, moreover,
that it is within his power to change
his condition and that speedily.</p>

<p>After all, human life and effort are governed
largely by the conscious or unconscious
value put upon the varied elements
that go to make up the daily round.</p>

<p>It seems to be a universal law that
effort must precede satisfaction, from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
infant feeding to the man building up a
successful business. The satisfaction grows
in a measure as the effort was a prolonged
or sustained one.</p>

<p>Well-being is a product of effort and
resulting satisfaction. The child without
interest in work or play does not develop;
the man with no stimulus walks through
life as in a dream.</p>

<p>The first steps in &#8220;civilizing&#8221; (?) a
nation or tribe are to suggest <i>wants</i>&mdash;things
to strive for. Struggle, with all its attendant
evils, seems the lever that moves the
world. It is therefore in line that health,
and whatever favors it, is to be gained at
the expense of struggle. The one necessary
element is that men should value it enough
to struggle for it.</p>

<p>Sanitary science above all others, when
applied, benefits the whole people, raises
the level of productive life.</p>

<p>In the rapid development of our civilization,
the laboratory, the shop, the school
can be the quickest mediums of suggesting
wants.</p>

<p>In an earlier chapter, the indifference to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
clean conditions, the ignorance of the means
of obtaining pure food and clean air, were
dwelt upon, and still later the need of <i>will</i>
to choose the right thing.</p>

<p>Now we should consider the means of
stimulating that choice. So far it has been
chiefly exploitation for the personal gain
of the manufacturer, who has persuaded the
people to buy his product regardless of its
economic or hygienic effect. Thrift has
been undermined most subtly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the secret of the whole situation
we&#8217;re talking about; it&#8217;s easier to buy a new
shirt than to take care of the one you&#8217;ve
got.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>All sense of values has been lost, so that
with no sound basis choice is apt to be
unwise, unsatisfactory, and is gradually
dropped, while the individual drifts.</p>

<p>No more effective agent for the dissemination
of knowledge was ever devised than
the American Public School. If only it
would live up to its opportunities, its teachers
could bring to its millions of receptive
minds the best practice in daily living
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>(never mind the theory for the children),
and through the children reach the home,
where the infants may be saved from the
risks that the elders have run.</p>

<p>To be effective, however, school conditions
should be satisfactory, and teachers
should be familiar with the best ways of
living, or at least in active sympathy with
the medical inspector and the school nurse.</p>

<p>No more revolting revelations have ever
been made than those usually locked in the
hearts of these faithful servants of the people.
How they can have courage to go on
in face of parental and community indifference
is a marvel. We shall consider in the
next chapter how the average parent is to
be aroused.</p>

<p>But the leaders in educational and scientific
thought&mdash;what of them? The school
is the pride of the community and measures
the progress of the community toward
ideals. Alas, how is pride laid low in most
public school buildings in the inability of
most of the teachers to see the relations
between mental stupidity and bad air.</p>

<p>The awakening has begun, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and thousands of teachers have responded
and are urging authorities to burn more
coal, to employ more help, to keep the house
clean, to make it more beautiful, to make
the curriculum more helpful, to make provision
for good food to be purchased, and
the hundred ways in which the school may
be the most powerful civilizing factor the
nation has. <i>But civilization must not spell
disease and ruin.</i></p>

<p>The economic factor must not be lost
sight of. To tell the boy and girl that they
are as good as any does not give them the
right to the most expensive food and clothing
they see. How shall they choose wisely
in the multitude of new things? They
wish the best, naturally, and all America
is honeycombed with the wrong idea that
the best costs the most. An Alaska Indian
came into the store in Juneau one day to
buy some canned peas. The storekeeper
said, &#8220;I am out of the brand you want.&#8221;
&#8220;No peas?&#8221; asked the Indian. &#8220;No, only
some small cans of French peas at forty
cents a can. You don&#8217;t want those.&#8221; &#8220;Why
not? Me want the best.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>The schools of domestic economy, the
classes in all grade schools, will have to
attack and conquer these prejudices as to
values, or, rather, will need to substitute
right estimates of value before our people
will choose wisely in distributing their income,
for that is what right living means.
The division of the income according to
the necessities of health and efficiency, not
according to whim or selfish desire, is sometimes
estimated as</p>

<table summary="expenses">
<tr><td>20 to 25 per cent for rent</td></tr>
<tr><td>25 to 30 per cent for food</td></tr>
<tr><td>10 to 15 per cent for clothing</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="newchapter">This leaves only forty-five or thirty per
cent for other things, and the pennies must
be carefully counted to cover fuel, light,
amusements, education, books, insurance,
or investments. Something that the family
would like must be left out&mdash;no matter
what, providing only it does not injure their
efficiency as wage-earners, as comfortable
human beings.</p>

<p>The sensation of comfort or satisfaction
is so completely a psychic factor that the
school training has a great chance to affect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
after life. The child can acquire the habit
of being more comfortable in plain, washable,
clean clothes, with clean hands, than
in dirty, ragged furbelows. This habit once
thoroughly acquired is not likely to be
quickly lost. Provision for clean hands is
a necessity in school, and ways of making a
small amount of soap and water serve may
also be taught. All the while, care is to be
taken not to introduce unnecessarily expensive
materials or to inculcate over-refined
notions.</p>

<p>Sound instruction as to dangers of transference
of saliva, of nose discharge, etc., can
be given without also giving the despair of
impossible achievement.</p>

<p>The teaching in the classes must have
this practical bearing on daily life. It is
insisted on here because unclean hands are
the chief source of infectious disease.</p>

<p>Instead of blaming water supplies, dusty
streets, or even contagion by the breath,
sanitarians are everywhere putting emphasis
upon the actual contact of moist mucus
with milk and other food, in preparation or
in serving. It is not a supercilious notion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
to examine tumblers for finger marks, or to
object to the habit of wetting the finger with
saliva in turning leaves of books. These
little unclean acts are the unconscious habits
that cling to a person in spite of education
from reading. The greatest service to be
done today in improving the health of the
community is in the application of the principles
which may be summed up in the
phrases&mdash;fresh air all the twenty-four hours,
clean hands the livelong day, the free use
of the handkerchief to protect from contamination
of mouth and nose.</p>

<p>All these small personal habits should
be taught in the earliest months of life, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>,
in the home; but if the child reaches school
untaught, then in defense of the whole community
the school must insist upon teaching
them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">S</span>omething</span> in motion and something
to eat attract the crowd.</p>

<p>The social worker is just beginning to
realize what the manufacturer and the
department storekeeper have long since
found out.</p>

<p>Why is it not legitimate to &#8220;attract a
crowd,&#8221; to do them a good service in showing
them how to save money as well as in
impelling them to spend it? It is wiser
to <i>show how</i> before explaining why.</p>

<p>The force of example, the power of
suggestion, should be used fully before coercion
is applied. Exhibits and models
come before law.</p>

<p>The psychology of influence is an interesting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
study (see M&uuml;nsterberg&#8217;s article,
<i>McClure&#8217;s</i>, November, 1909). Its principles
have been grasped and used by those
who exploit human feelings for their own
gain. The student of social conditions
should make a wider and better use of a
real force.</p>

<p>Publicity is perhaps first. Exhibits
showing existing conditions often shock
people into attention, for it is inattention
more than anything else that prevent
betterment.</p>

<p>It is said that &#8220;a knowledge of danger
is the surest means of guarding against
it,&#8221; but this knowledge must be translated
into belief and the danger be brought
home to the individual as a member of the
community.</p>

<p>Exhibits may often suggest for existing
evils simple remedies never thought of before.
They should never suggest the one
idea without the other. Even though the
remedy is not worked out, it should be
called for. America&#8217;s inventive power
may well be turned on its own social affairs
as well as on adaptation of European
machinery.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>The man considered in these pages is
the man in community environment, and
the discussion is as to what controls this
community life. It will be acknowledged
by all thoughtful persons that the prime
control lies in the purpose for which the
community exists. If for selfish gain, then
all is sacrificed to that end. Men and
women become mere machines and children
are only in the way until they, too, may be
put into the service.</p>

<p>If it exists for mutual help and general
advance in civilization, then the leaders in
the community take into account the elements
that contribute to the future as well
as those for the immediate present.</p>

<p>In the confusion of ideas resulting from
the rapid, almost cancerous growth of the
modern community, made possible by mechanical
invention, the people have lost the
power of visualizing their conception of
right and wrong, a power which made the
Puritan such a force in early colonial times.
Heaven and hell were very real to him and
were powerful factors in influencing his
daily life. The average man today has no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
such spur to good behavior. Perhaps the
sword of Damocles must be visualized by
such exhibits as the going out of an electric
light every time a man dies, by the ghastly
microbe in the moving picture, by the
highly colored print or by a vivid reproduction
of crowded quarters. The social
worker has been doubtful of the real value
of such exhibits, but such reminders have
their place in a community accustomed to
the advertising of less worthy subjects.</p>

<p>A decided recognition of the value of
exhibits is found in the advertisement of a
company: &#8220;We design and equip Exhibits
on Tuberculosis, Milk, Civic Betterment,
Dental Hygiene, Saner Fourth of July.
Have you our catalogue?&#8221; Much of our
educational work for the dissemination of
useful knowledge would gain in power
and directness from an adaptation of the
methods of the man skilled in promoting
commercial interests. He knows how to
apply the right stimulus at the right time
in order to arouse the desired interest.</p>

<p>In many ways the adult is but the child
of a larger growth, who needs something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
concrete to make him understand. And so
have grown up the great industrial fairs
and exhibitions. One comes away from
these wondering that so much, both good
and bad, is being prepared for him, and
stimulated, usually, to work out certain
suggestions and better many of the present
conditions. Both the manufacturer and the
consumer have been helped.</p>

<p>Wherever it is possible, a working
model illustrating the chief features to be
explained should be installed. The expense
of this kind of exhibit has in the past been
prohibitive, and moreover the use of such
&#8220;claptrap&#8221; has been frowned upon; but
scientific knowledge is no longer to be held
within the aristocratic circle of the university.
It is to be brought within the reach
of the man in the street, and to make up for
the wasted years of seclusion experts now
vie with each other in putting cause and
effect not merely into words but into pictures,
and even into motion pictures. The
fly as a carrier of disease is now shown
in all its busy and disgusting activity. The
lesson of awakened attention by such means<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
is being learned, and soon lessons in botany,
in gardening, in housewifery, will be given
through the eye, to be the better followed
by the hand.</p>

<p>Of all means, that product of man&#8217;s ingenuity,
the moving picture, is destined
to play the greatest part in quick education.
It is the quintessence of democracy.</p>

<p>The extension movement in education is
an evidence of a new social ideal. It is a
true expression of democracy that the university
and school can be utilized by the
busy working people. Museums that at one
time were only for the educated who by
previous training could understand them
now assume as a privilege the educating
of all the people. Schools of art and
science, also, through lectures, bulletins,
guides, and special exhibits, extend a generous
welcome to the public.</p>

<p>The citizens ought to be a gladder, sadder
people, stirred and delighted and grateful
for much that the city affords; sad and
shocked by some of the forbidding, existing
conditions. That is the power of an exhibit,
so to visualize a condition that the mind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
really conceives it, never again to recover
from the shock, to be unmindful of such
possibilities of degraded existence for human
beings.</p>

<p>The influence of these great expositions
is of a most subtle kind, not often to be
traced, but there is a noticeable change in
the estimation in which Home Economics
is held dating from the time of the Mary
Lowell Stone Home Economics Exhibit
held at the Exposition in St. Louis in 1905.
This illustrated the application of modern
knowledge to home life, chiefly in economic
and &aelig;sthetic lines, all bearing upon the
health and efficiency of the people. The
Chicago Exposition in 1893 had its Rumford
Kitchen, an exhibit under the auspices
of the State of Massachusetts. This practical
illustration of scientific principles
modified the ideas of the world as to the
place and importance of cookery in education.
Indeed, there seemed a distinct danger
that other lines would be neglected, so that
when the Exposition at St. Louis was determined
upon this legacy of fifteen years before
was drawn upon to show the wide scope
of the subject as it had been developed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>Boards of Health might pave the way
for a better understanding of their rules and
regulations if they would have temporary
exhibits in public places of some of the conditions
known to them but unsuspected by
the average citizen and taxpayer.</p>

<p>Traveling exhibits may show local and
temporary conditions and may call attention
to needs demanding immediate remedy&mdash;with
the remedy suggested.</p>

<p>Permanent exhibits in museums should,
on the other hand, teach a deeper lesson.
They should always be constructive and
should be replaced when the conditions
have changed. The modern idea of a museum
is a series of adjustable exhibits with
distinct suggestive purpose. Such are found
in the Town Room, 3 Joy Street, Boston,
the Social Museum, Harvard College, the
American Museum of Safety, and the Sanitary
Science Section, American Museum of
Natural History, New York.</p>

<p>The distribution of the printed word
has become so universal that it would seem
as if every family might be influenced by
it; but the scientific title, or the size of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
book, or the scientific terms seem forbidding,
and so the whole question is thrust
aside.</p>

<p>In the past, newspaper science was
largely discounted as sensational and only
one-tenth fact. Scientific workers were
largely to blame for this. They could not
take the time to explain the meaning of their
work, and the few things they were ready
to say were worked over out of all semblance
to truth by the writer who must have a
&#8220;story&#8221; and who had not the training in
&#8220;suspension of judgment&#8221; which the scientific
investigator knows to be necessary.</p>

<p>There is no concern of human life that
cannot be made interesting, and the magazine
writers of today understand that art.
Read the newspaper and the world is yours.
It is all things to all men. The popularizing
of knowledge is now proceeding on
somewhat better lines. Intermediaries between
the laboratory and the people are
springing up to interpret the one to the
other. This work is good or bad according
to the individual writer. Most of it is still
too superficial. Here is one of the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
fertile fields for the educated woman, since
the evils of which we complain have to do
so intimately with woman&#8217;s province, the
home and the school. There is hope that
the trained, scientific woman will take her
place as interpreter. Her practical sense
will give her an advantage over the young
man who has never known other home than
a boarding house.</p>

<p>But the expert knows that the man of
&#8220;practical affairs&#8221; wants and needs certain
knowledge, and so seeks another way. Our
Federal government, through the departments
of Agriculture and Education; the
State Boards of Health; the educational institutions,
have with care and accuracy formulated
this knowledge and are sending to
the people, in the form of bulletins meeting
their interest and requirements, knowledge
in concise and readable form, and so most
valuable. More than five hundred thousand
copies of Miss Maria Parloa&#8217;s bulletin
on Preserving have been distributed by the
Department of Agriculture.</p>

<p>These efforts by both men and women
have meant independent scientific research,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
which is often the only available knowledge
for the housekeeper. It is bringing to them
in their &#8220;business&#8221; of life the same help
that the men on the farm and elsewhere are
receiving in theirs.</p>

<p>But the written word, however clearly
put, can never reach the untrained as can
the voice and personality of an earnest
speaker with a compelling vitality. Lectures
by those who have been engaged in
research themselves, so that they have
absorbed the spirit of the laboratory&mdash;not
by those who have merely smelled the odors
of the waste jars&mdash;are ten times more valuable
than even the most attractively illustrated
articles. It is well that the personality
of the human being is an asset, and
that there is a stimulus in hearing and seeing
the person who has accomplished things.
There is always a power in the spoken word.
The government, with its public lectures,
recognizes this as well as the private organization,
and today ignorance is necessarily
due only to indifference.</p>

<p>Illustrated lectures followed by literature
are of inestimable value if rightly and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
not sensationally given. Even then, the
seed must have time to sprout.</p>

<p>Man has reached his present stage of
civilization, however we regard it, by an
incessant warfare against adverse conditions.
Enemies, man and beast, surrounded
him; mountains and rivers obstructed his
passage; fire and flood swept away his dwellings;
but ever onward the inward impulse
has carried him.</p>

<p>It is interesting to see how the same
vocabulary is transferred to the warfare
for social betterment, &#8220;campaign,&#8221; &#8220;warfare,&#8221;
&#8220;battle,&#8221; &#8220;fight,&#8221; &#8220;weapon,&#8221; &#8220;corps,&#8221;
&#8220;army.&#8221; And the fight to be won can only
come through knowledge, its dissemination
and then its application.</p>

<p>Publicity today means co&ouml;peration and
democracy&mdash;all to help, all to be helped.</p>

<p>All the foregoing methods should be
used in these campaigns for health, with
the dictum, &#8220;Man, know thyself.&#8221;</p>

<h3>LEGISLATIVE COMPULSION</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">G</span>overnment</span> is delegated to persons
specially set apart for the oversight
of the people&#8217;s welfare.</p>

<p>Personal conduct was free from such
delegated power in the Anglo-Saxon
thought. The Englishman&#8217;s house was his
castle inviolate. This was especially true
of the early American settlers. Laws interfering
with personal liberty, a man&#8217;s right
to drink tea, to punish his own children, to
beat his own wife, to keep his own muck-heap,
have been deeply resented by the
American citizen. Each step in the protection
of his neighbor has been taken only by
a struggle extending the common law of
nuisance to a variety of conditions.</p>

<p>The protection of the man against himself,
and of his wife and child against his
ignorance or greed, is one of the twentieth
century tasks yet hardly begun.</p>

<p>The control of man&#8217;s environment for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
his own good as a function of government
is a comparatively new idea in republican
democracy. The cry of paternalism is
quickly raised, on the one hand, of socialism,
on the other. Each gain has been at the
cost of a hard-fought battle. But it is certain
that the individual must delegate more
or less of his so-called rights for the sake of
the race, and since the only excuse for the
existence of the individual is the race, he
must so far relinquish his authority.</p>

<p>It is a part of the urban trend that the
will of the man, of the head of the family,
should be superseded by that of the community,
city, state, nation.</p>

<p>Even though all the agencies for the
education of both young people and adults
that have been discussed in the preceding
chapters were set in motion at once, there
would still remain many thousands in township
and city untouched by these forces, or
so touched as to arouse rebellion against
such novel notions.</p>

<p>Only the child can be educated to acquire
habits of right living so perfectly that
the suitable action takes place unconsciously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Twenty years hence these trained children
will be the chief citizens of the republic,
the leaders of public opinion. Today, however,
less gentle means, less gradual processes,
must be used in order that these children
may have a chance to grow up.</p>

<p>In the social republic, the child as a
future citizen is an asset of the state, not the
property of its parents. Hence its welfare
is a direct concern of the state. Preventive
medicine is in this sense truly State Medicine,
and means protection of the people
from their own ignorance.</p>

<p>In the laws made with this end in view
lies one of the greatest educative agencies
known. We have referred in the last chapter
to the need of drawing attention to defects
and dangers in order that people may know
what the results of their careless ways may
be. No surer way has been found to fix
attention than to attempt to enforce a law
or collect a fine for disobedience of it. A
marked illustration of this truth is given
in the case of the ordinance against spitting
in street cars. In many cities a notice
was posted in each car&mdash;usually with little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
effect. In some a fine of five dollars was
added, with little more result. Boston was
one of the first cities to pass an ordinance,
and it accompanied the law with a fine of
one hundred dollars. This compelled attention&mdash;a
sum which represented to the
workman more than his yearly savings,
more than any single expenditure. To the
business man, even, it was a sum not to
be lightly dropped on a filthy car floor.
This mere statement of the value of cleanness
made an almost instantaneous change
in the habits of thousands. Within two
days the car floors became practically free
without a single fine being collected within
that time, as far as the author is aware.</p>

<p>The law imposing fines for neglect of
removal of garbage or of screening stables
must be occasionally enforced in order to
express degree of disapproval. A petty
fine is of little use.</p>

<p>Conditions of motion, of rapid intermingling
of distant populations&mdash;a thousand
miles in a day is now possible&mdash;make
national control a necessity. It is proved
that quick results may be gained in saving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
lives and property by that prompt
and thorough action which well-equipped
Federal forces alone possess. The stamping
out of yellow fever in Cuba, the redemption
of Panama, the suppression of
sporadic outbreaks at New Orleans, the
quick response to a discovery, as in the
cases of pellagra and the hookworm&mdash;all
these show what a thoroughly alive government
may do.</p>

<p>It is no disgrace to an individual or a
city to have the national laboratory make
discoveries, to have the national power put
down epidemics, as it does civil rebellion,
for the good of the whole nation. It is disgraceful,
however, for the citizen to remain
indifferent or obstructive, to grumble over
the cost. The indifference of the people
themselves is today almost the only stumbling
block to national prosperity.</p>

<p>The time lost to the average worker by
inefficient labor is a drain on the community
largely avoidable, and is the cause of that
other drain on the moral as well as physical
vitality&mdash;charity.</p>

<p>Preventive medicine is a science by itself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
a combination of social and scientific
forces guided by research quickly applied,
and it must be accepted and upheld by
those whom it benefits, namely, all the
citizens. The nation is in many cases the
only power strong enough to command
confidence, and in the combination of government
effort an international science of
human welfare is bound to be evolved.</p>

<p>It is a waste of effort for each state to
prepare a fly pamphlet. The correctness
of a Government Bulletin would give an
added value as well as the rapidity of circulation.
The bulletins of the Agricultural
Department are an example.</p>

<p>The Weather Service, with its quick
notifications, shows what a health service
might do. A monthly or weekly <i>health
chart</i> would give the best and worst spots.</p>

<p>Precautions really workable might be
furnished the Associated Press.</p>

<p>In short, system and science might be
put at the service of the local health officer,
of the traveler, and even of the housewife.</p>

<p>The Library of Congress now furnishes
cards in duplicate to a large number of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
centers, thus saving time to the investigator
and giving information often not otherwise
obtainable.</p>

<p>The Farmers&#8217; Bulletins of the Department
of Agriculture are also most valuable
to the people who are in search of help.
Such agencies might be extended without
fear of trespass on any existing agencies.</p>

<p>Just as the individual, if he is to do and
be his best, accepts his limitations, obeys
Nature&#8217;s law, and thrives in body and estate
in consequence, and as the community banding
together makes and carries out with
penalties for deviation certain regulations
for mutual benefit, so must the still larger
groups&mdash;the state and the nation&mdash;use their
larger wisdom and wider knowledge for the
benefit of all. The individual should recognize
the value to himself of this more complete
investigation, and instead of raising
the cry of paternalism and national interference,
should welcome all aids to increased
efficiency.</p>

<p>State hygiene is necessary to supplement
municipal hygiene. Often the rural district
has no other hygiene, and the city and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
country are interdependent, the city dependent
upon the country for its water, milk, and
other supplies.</p>

<p>Almost all the states are alive to the importance
of milk inspection. As early as
1869 in Massachusetts, Dr. Bowditch called
the Board of Health &#8220;The State Medicine,&#8221;
and quotes from Dr. Farr: &#8220;How out of the
<i>existing</i> seed to raise races of men to divine
perfection is the final problem of public
medicine.&#8221; That is the function of all
boards of health. If factories are incorporated
under state laws, they must also be
governed by the state regulations for health.</p>

<p>Here in America we are always locking
the stable door after the horse has been
stolen. Not until many &#8220;accidents&#8221; had
occurred in the use of antitoxins did Congress
pass an act (1902) regulating the manufacture
and interstate sale of the viruses,
serums, toxins, etc. The supervision and
control were vested in the Secretary of the
Treasury through the Public Health and
Marine Hospital Service. Previous to
April 1, 1905, there was no official standard
for measuring the strength of diphtheria<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
antitoxin. Previous to October 25, 1907,
there were as many units or standards for
tetanus antitoxin as there were producers.
One was labeled &#8220;6,000,000 units per c.c.&#8221;
and another &#8220;0.75 unit per c.c.,&#8221; while, according
to official standard, the first had
only 90 and the latter 770.</p>

<p>The point to be made is that however
faulty an official or Federal standard for
sanitary devices may be, it is a standard, and
so is of service in protecting the people,
especially those away from active centers
of research.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<h3>WOMAN&#8217;S RESPONSIBILITY</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here</span> are about 40,000,000 women
and girls in the United States. About
14,000,000 live in the country and have a
direct and compelling power over the life
of the community.</p>

<p>In rural agricultural districts the home-keeper
is the provider. She practically
requisitions from farm and garden what she
deems necessary for the family table. To
an extent she makes the clothing and sews
the house linen. She also exchanges her
perquisites, egg money, perhaps, for furniture
and ornaments. The itinerant peddler
brings the world&#8217;s wares to her door; the
mail-order houses do the rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ideal home is a social and co&ouml;perative
society in which all of its members
unite their efforts for the common good.
This ideal is realized most nearly in the
country home, where even the smallest child
has opportunity to be and generally is a contributor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
to the family support. It has come
to be a recognized fact that boys and girls,
healthy, industrious, frugal, capable, intelligent,
self-supporting, cheerful, and patriotic,
abound in country homes, and that the
prevalence there of these high qualities is
largely due to the family life, which requires
each individual from his earliest
years to bear his proportionate share in
providing for the maintenance of the home.
By bringing within the reach of the country
people educational advantages suited to
their needs, rural life becomes more attractive,
country homes are multiplied, and the
valuable qualities which these homes develop
become the possession of a correspondingly
larger number of the citizenship of
the state.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The government has recognized the need
and the possibilities of meeting it in the
recognition it has given to Farmers&#8217; Institutes
for women, in which, by lectures, demonstration,
and short winter courses at the
colleges, the interest of the woman in her
occupation is aroused. She is not only given
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>help in details of her daily work, but she is
shown how much the efficiency of the farm
life depends upon her capability and intelligence.
She is encouraged in the using of all
mechanical and scientific appliances, is introduced
to the means of mental growth;
but, best of all, she is given the stimulus of
social recognition. In the year 1908 there
were held 832 such meetings in the several
states. In the year 1910 the number will be
nearly or quite doubled.</p>

<p>In no other form of society is the power
of the woman for good or ill so paramount
as in rural life, in no other mode of living is
the family so much at her mercy.</p>

<p>In suburban and city life the family can
in a measure escape from insufficient care
and uncomfortable conditions. That they
do so escape, any student of social tendencies
will testify. The great increase of restaurants,
of clubs and hotels of all grades,
shows one phase of the unattractiveness of
home life. The city woman is only half a
housekeeper; she has only one-eighth of a
house as compared with her rural sister.
Her control is therefore curtailed until she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
feels her helplessness in the hands of her
landlord. She sighs and turns to other interests.
To her must be brought the knowledge
of her power as a social factor if she
will but use the knowledge she can easily
gain.</p>

<p>The city woman has amused herself
because she has seen nothing better to do
with her time. The utilization of her ability
is all that is needed to regenerate city
life. Without it all efforts will prove fruitless.
Education of all women in the principles
of sanitary science is the key to race
progress in the twentieth century.</p>

<p>As an economic factor, the influence of
the housewife is of the greatest moment.
Production on the farm is only one phase.
The city and suburban dweller is a buyer,
not a producer. In suburban and city life
the housekeeper has more temptations to
buy needless articles, food out of season, to
go often to the shops, especially on bargain
days. She thinks her taste is educated, when
it is only aroused to notice what others like.
She is led to strive after effects without
knowing how to attain them. It has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
estimated by advertising experts that ninety
per cent of the purchases of the community
are determined by women, not always according
to their judgment, but by a suppression
of it. Woman is made to think
that she must buy certain lines of goods.
The power of suggestion has been referred
to in a preceding chapter.</p>

<p>When civilization, as it is called, persuaded
woman to give up manufacture
and to become a buyer, the first step in
the disintegration of the home as a center
of information, as well as of industry, was
taken. The housewife and mother were
made to look to the dealer, and thus to feel
their helplessness. This sense of ignorance,
this subconscious loss of power over things,
only increased the effect of that fatalism
which the control of machinery was leading
man out from under.</p>

<p>It is barely fifty years since woman began
to ask questions and insist upon knowing,
to claim freedom of movement, a chance
to breathe. The time between has been a
time of plowed fields, often muddy, usually
stony, but the furrows are turning green and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the harvest will prove the wisdom of the
plowing.</p>

<p>Woman had to struggle for right to private
judgment and public action. Some
pioneers had to enter the field of research,
of investigation, in order that they might
call to those below that the way was open.
This vast company, which has been nearly
untouched by the scientific spirit, was
warned off the field of investigation, and
society is paying the penalty of its own
blindness.</p>

<p>In the very field where applied science
can most serve human welfare, scarecrows
have been set up most prominently. Not
until society avails itself of those qualities of
mind sorely needed in the field of sanitary
science, patient attention to detail, strong,
practical sense directed by a profound interest
in the subject, will it begin to show
what height it is capable of scaling.</p>

<p>The intrusting of so many great fortunes
to women shows an increasing confidence in
their judgment of social needs. It shows
that woman&#8217;s education has passed the selfish
stage, that it has given a wider vision of
the whole horizon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be said without fear of contradiction
that the future well-being of society
is largely in the hands of woman. What
will she do with it? Responsibility is always
sobering.</p>

<p>Let her once realize her position and
woman will rise to the task. Instances are
not wanting of groups attacking scientific
and administrative problems in the true
spirit, without sentimental charity, to which
in the past women have been prone.</p>

<p>If civic authorities felt that women&#8217;s
leagues were informed bodies of women
whose suggestions they would make no
error in adopting, more legislation could
be effected. Too often city councils are
approached by those who favor some whim
or fad, and so <small>ALL</small> women&#8217;s demands are
classed together. Much harm has been
done to the cause by indiscreet, pushing
women with only a glimmer of knowledge.
The question is not <small>WOMAN</small>, but ability and
women. It is better, as a rule, to work out
ideas through existing organizations.</p>

<p>All the problems of environment which
we have been considering would be solved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
in half the time, yes, in one-quarter, if all
housewives would combine in carrying out
the knowledge which some of them have
and which all may have.</p>

<p>Infant mortality is controllable through
the training of the mother and nurse. Unsanitary
houses are the results of careless
housekeeping, usually a product of apathetic
fatalism. Landlords assume that the
woman will submit. When she has a woman
sanitary inspector to appeal to, matters will
take on a different aspect.</p>

<p>Unsanitary alleys exist because the abutters
do not complain loudly enough to the
right authorities. Dirty markets have been
so long tolerated because women buyers
carried the same fatalism to the stalls&mdash;&#8220;what
is, has to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>Society is only just beginning to realize
that it has at its command today for its own
regeneration a great unused force in its army
of housewives, teachers, mothers, conscious
of power but uncertain how to use it. Perhaps
the most progressive movement of the
times is one led by women who see clearly
that cleanness is above charity, that moral<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
support must be given to those who know
but do not dare to do right, and that knowledge
must be brought to the ignorant. Nothing
can stop this most notable progress but
a relapse into apathy and fatalism of the
vast army of women now being enlisted to
fight disease.</p>

<p>The opportunity has come, the responsibility
is woman&#8217;s hereafter. No one can
take it from her; she has knowledge. The
door has opened, she has taken the weapons
in hand, is learning to use them. Will she
falter on the eve of victory simply because
it involves some sacrifice of prejudice or
tradition? Must she not boldly accept the
twentieth century challenge and fight her
way to victory, even at some &aelig;sthetic sacrifice?
In another hundred years, then, Euthenics
may give place to Eugenics, and the
better race of men become an actuality.</p>

<p>The keeping of the house, the laundry
work, the cleaning, the cooking, the daily
oversight, must have for its conscious end
the welfare of the family. It cannot be
done without labor, but the labor in this
as in any process may be lightened by
thought and by machinery.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Knowledge of labor-saving appliances
is today everywhere demanded of the successful
establishment <small>EXCEPT</small> of the family
home. Is it not time that it came in for its
share? If the housewife would use wisely
the information at her hand today, it is safe
to say that in six cases out of ten she could
cut in half the housekeeping budget and
double the comfort of living.</p>

<p>As conditions are, the twentieth century
sees a strange phenomenon&mdash;the most vital
of all processes, the raising of children,
carried on under adverse conditions; human
labor and life being held of as little account
as in the days of building the pyramids.</p>

<p>Women may be trained to become the
economic leaders in the body politic. It is
doubtful if life will be anything but wasteful
until they are trained to realize their
responsibility.</p>

<p>The housewife was told that she must
stay at home and do her work. This was
preached <i>at</i> her, written <i>at</i> her, but no one
of them all, save, perhaps, the Englishmen
Lecky and H.&nbsp;G. Wells, saw the problem in
its social significance, saw that the work of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
home-making in this engineering age must
be worked out on engineering principles,
and with the co&ouml;peration of both trained
men and trained women. The mechanical
setting of life is become an important factor,
and this new impulse which is showing itself
so clearly today for the modified construction
and operation of the family home
is the final crown or seal of the conquest of
the last stronghold of conservatism, the
home-keeper.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, if not today, the woman who
is to be really mistress of her house must
be an engineer, so far as to be able to
understand the use of machines and to believe
what she is told. Your ham-and-eggs
woman was of the old type, now gone by in
the fight for the right to think.</p>

<p>The emergence from the primitive condition
was slow because the few of us who
did show our heads were beaten down and
told we did not know. It has required many
college women (from some 50,000 college
women graduates) to build and run houses
and families successfully, here one and there
another, until the barrel of flour has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
leavened. Society <i>is</i> being reorganized, not
in sudden, explosive ways, but underneath
all the froth and foam the yeast has been
working. The world is going to the bad
only if one believes that material progress
is bad. If we can see the new heaven and
the new earth in it, then we may have faith
in the future.</p>

<p>The human elements of love and sacrifice,
of foresight and of faith, are going to
persist, and any apparent upheaval is only
because of settling down into a more solid
condition, a readjustment to circumstances.
As Caroline Hunt has said<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>: &#8220;We may disregard
the popular fear that the home will
finally take upon itself the characteristics of
a public institution.... Human intelligence,
which suits means to ends, and which is ever
coming to the aid of human affection, will
prevent that. So long as affection lasts it will
seek satisfactory expression in home life,
and so long as intelligence endures it will
stand in the way of the extension of the
borders of the home beyond the possibilities
of the mutual helpfulness to its members.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>
<p>The persistent efforts of the farsighted
to secure a place in education for the subjects
fundamental to the modern home are
now respectfully listened to.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, not strange that the first
successes in modern housekeeping were
gained in public institutions, for there accounts
were kept and saving told. When
one hospital saved $12,000 in one year by
an expenditure of $2,000 for a trained
woman, trustees began to take notice. When
large state institutions were reorganized
and made over from unsavory scandals
into reputable and life-saving establishments,
even legislators took notice. The
trained woman superintendent proved not
only more competent but less affected by
perquisites.</p>

<p>(I do not vouch for the universal maintenance
of this high standard when women
managers have had longer experience; but
so far conscience and sterling integrity have
been attributes of all my expert women,
even if they have now and then disappointed
me in endurance or in ability. Is not this
a fact of great social significance?)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>It is universally conceded today, only a
few willfully blind or croaking pessimists
dissenting, that home-keeping under modern
conditions requires a knowledge of conditions
and a power of control of persons and
machines obtained only through education
or through bitter experience, and that education
is the less costly.</p>

<p>When social conditions become adjusted
to the new order, it will be seen how much
gain in power the community has made,
how much better worth the people are.
Have faith in the working out of the destiny
of the race; be ready to accept the
unaccustomed, to use the radium of social
progress to cure the ulcers of the old friction.
What if a few mistakes are made?
How else shall the truth be learned? Try
all things and hold fast that which is good.</p>

<p>The Home Economics Movement is an
endeavor to hold the home and the welfare
of children from slipping over the cliff by
a knowledge which will bring courage to
combat the destructive tendencies. Is not
one of the distinctive features of our age
a forcible overcoming of the natural trend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
of things? If a river is by natural law
wearing away its bank in a place we wish
to keep, do we sit down and moan and say
it is sad, but we cannot help it? No, that
attitude belonged to the Middle Ages. We
say, Hold fast, we cannot have that; and
we cement the sides and confine or turn the
river.</p>

<p>The ancient cities whose ruins are now
being explored in Asia seem to have been
abandoned because of failure of the water
supply as the earth became desiccated; so
was the home of our own Zunis. Does such
a possibility stop us? No, we bring water
from hundreds of miles. Will man, who
has gained such control over nature, sit
down before his own problems and say,
&#8220;What am I going to do about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>What if the apparent motion is toward
cells to sleep in, and clubs to play bridge in,
and amusements for evenings, and a strenuous
business life, run on piratical principles,
into which the women are drawn as decoy
ducks? Because this <i>is</i>, is it going to be,
as soon as a good proportion of the thinking
people stand face to face with the problem?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
I believe it is possible to solve the problem,
but only if the aid of scientifically trained
women is brought into service to work in
harmony with the engineer who has already
accomplished so much.</p>

<p>Household engineering is the great need
for material welfare, and social engineering
for moral and ethical well-being. What
else does this persistent forcing of scientific
training to the front mean? If the State is
to have good citizens, productive human
beings, it must provide for the teaching of
the essentials to those who are to become
the parents of the next generation. No state
can thrive while its citizens waste their resources
of health, bodily energy, time and
brain power, any more than a nation may
prosper that wastes its natural resources.</p>

<p>The teaching of domestic economy in
the elementary school and home economics
in the higher is intended to give the people
a sense of <i>control</i> over their <i>environment</i>
and to avert a panic as to the future.</p>

<p>The economics of consumption, including
as it does the ethics of spending, must
have a place in our higher education, preceded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
in earlier grades by manual dexterity
and scientific information, which will lead
to true economy in the use of time, energy,
and money in the home life of the land.
Education is obliged to take cognizance of
the need, because the ideal American homestead,
that place of busy industry, with
occupation for the dozen children, no longer
exists. Gone out of it are the industries,
gone out of it are ten of the children, gone
out of it in large measure is that sense of
moral and religious responsibility which
was the keystone of the whole.</p>

<p>The methods of work imposed by housing
conditions are wasteful of time, energy,
and money, and the people are restive, they
know not why. As was said earlier, shelter
was found by early students of social conditions
to be most in need of remedy, so we
see that</p>

<p>&#8220;In the first place the state is beginning
to offer positive aid to secure a suitable
home for each family. A communistic habitation
forces the members of a family to
conform insensibly to communistic modes of
thought. Paul Goehre, in his keen observations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
printed in &#8216;Three Months in a German
Workshop,&#8217; interpreted this tendency in all
clearness. The architecture of a city tenement
house is to blame for the silent but
certain transformation of the home into a
sty. Instead of accepting this condition as
inevitable, like a law of nature, and accepting
its consequences, all experience demands
of those who believe in the monogamic family,
that they make a united and persistent
fight on the evil which threatens the slowly
acquired qualities secured in the highest
form of the family. It would be unworthy
of us to permit a great part of a modern
population to descend again to the animal
level from which the race has ascended only
through &aelig;ons of struggle and difficulty.
When we remember that very much, perhaps
most of the progress has been dearly
purchased at the cost of women, by the appeal
of her weakness and need and motherhood,
we must all the more firmly resolve
not to yield the field to a temporary effect
of a needless result of neglect and avarice.
As the evil conditions are merely the work
of unwise and untaught communities, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
cure will come from education of the same
communities in wisdom and science and
duty. What man has marred, man can make
better.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>It is not impossible to furnish a decent
habitation for every productive laborer in
all our great cities. Many really humane
people are overawed by the authority, the
pompous and powerful assertions of &#8220;successful&#8221;
men of affairs; and they often
sleep while such men are forming secret
conspiracies against national health and
morality with the aid of legal talent hired
to kill. Only when the social mind and
conscience is educated and the entire community
becomes intelligent and alert can
legislation be secured which places all
competitors on a level where humanity is
possible.</p>

<p>Here, again, the monogamic family is
the social interest at stake. It is a conflict
for altars and fires. We are told that all
these results are the effect of a natural, uniform
tendency in the progress of the business
world, and that it is useless to combat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>it. Professor Henderson reminds us that
tendency to uniformity revealed by statistics
may be reversed when resolute men and
women, possessed of higher ideals, unite to
resist it. Jacob A. Riis holds that these
evils are not by a decree of fate, but are the
result of positive wrong, and he dedicates
his &#8220;Ten Years&#8217; War&#8221; as follows&mdash;&#8220;to the
faint-hearted and those of little faith.&#8221;</p>

<p>In like manner we call today for more
faith in a way out of the slough of despond,
more resolute endeavor to improve social
and economic conditions. We beg the leaders
of public opinion to pause before they
condemn the efforts making to teach those
means of social control which may build
yet again a home life that will prove the
nursery of good citizens and of efficient
men and women with a sense of responsibility
to God and man for the use they make
of their lives.</p>

<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> checking of wastes of all description
is much in the air, but there is
less discussion about <small>WASTE OF EFFORT</small> than
might be expected. Yet effort means time,
and saving of time saves lives as well as
money.</p>

<p>Nearly every investigation of sanitary
evils leads back to the family home (or the
lack of one), and a great deal of the health
authorities&#8217; work is saving at the spigot
while there is a hundred times the waste
at the bunghole. The medical inspection of
the schools was found to have little effect
without the visiting school nurse, for the
parents did not know how to better conditions
and in the majority of cases did not
believe in the need.</p>

<p>Such experience should give the health
authorities a cue. Rules and Regulations
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>should be enforced, but enforced with instruction
as to the means of doing. The
<small>WHY</small> is not so easily understood as the student
of sanitary science seems to think.
Germs and microbes are empty air to the
street urchins until they have been shown on
a screen in a lecture hall or until cultures
have been made in the sight of the children
in a schoolroom. One whole school district
of intelligent parents was converted, many
years ago, by giving the children in one class
two Petri dishes each with sterile prepared
gelatine, with directions to open one in the
sitting room while it was being swept, and
two hours after the room had been thoroughly
dusted to open the other in the same
place for the same time. These &#8220;dust gardens,&#8221;
as the children called them, &#8220;took the
place of the family album&#8221; for callers, and
spread knowledge.</p>

<p>Hundreds of similar experiences should
convince any intelligent, earnest Board of
Health that a teacher by nature or training
should be in their employ, to be sent <small>WITH
POWER</small>, like any other inspector, wherever
ignorance&mdash;usually diagnosed as stubbornness&mdash;is
found.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>The health officer whose mother was a
good housekeeper, not afraid of work, has
no idea of the attitude of half the housewives
of his district. Having been made as
a boy &#8220;to get the dustpan and brush and
sweep up his whittlings,&#8221; he does not realize
that these houses in the tenement district
have no dustpans, and that no one would
bend his back to sweep up litter if there
were. It is all swept into the alley or the
street. Cheap, long-handled dustpans would
be valuable sanitary implements. As has
been elsewhere suggested, the garbage question
in the tenement house needs study and
must be solved by a practical housewife.
There are such, and Boards of Health are
wasting effort and the town&#8217;s money until
they avail themselves of this help in the enforcement
of their rules.</p>

<p>All Health Boards use the strong arm
of the law, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, a police inspector&#8217;s club, to
drive the ignorant and careless householder
to keep his premises from becoming a nuisance.
The newly-arrived, prospective citizen,
or more often citizeness, fails to understand
what it is all about&mdash;neither the words<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
nor the pantomime convey an idea, except
that this country is topsy-turvy anyway, for
everything is different in this new land.</p>

<p>In the process of learning what not to
do, the dwellers in the alleys flee when the
health officer appears, and oppose a stubborn
indifference to his threats. When his
back is turned, matters go on as before and
nothing is gained, but an opportunity is lost.
Law is a potent educator when rightly applied,
but it may work more harm than good.</p>

<p>Rules of action clearly explained are
soon accepted&mdash;like traffic rules, notification
of contagious diseases, disinfection, etc.</p>

<p>The placing on the force of each town
of at least one specially trained &#8220;Explainer&#8221;
would result in cleaner back yards and less
illness and, better than all else, a more
friendly feeling between the officials and
those they honestly wish to help; for I do
not think there is often justification for such
remarks as were made to me by a shrewd
California countryman when I was showing
him about in the traveling exhibit, the
sanitation car: &#8220;Oh, this is all to get a job.
It&#8217;s another form of graft&mdash;to get some
money to spend.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>It is true that the value of many health
measures does not appear on the surface.
Sometimes it is necessary to wait for vital
statistics to prove a gain.</p>

<p>It is beginning to be thrown in the faces
of sanitary authorities that the laboratory
wisdom does not reach the street; that there
is not enough, or rapid enough, improvement
in general conditions. Newspapers
are ready, for the most part, to disseminate
information and benevolent societies write
tracts, but we must remember how little
<small>WORDS</small> mean&mdash;especially printed words&mdash;to
those unaccustomed to acquiring information
that way.</p>

<p>The actual showing in an alley of the
process of cleaning up; the going into a
house and opening the windows at the top
and tacking on a wire netting to keep out
the flies; the actual cleaning of the garbage
pail, perhaps, or at least the standing by and
seeing that it is properly done&mdash;all such
actual doing, even if it is done only in one
house on a street, will spread the information
all over the neighborhood.</p>

<p>One of the most helpful offices is to tell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the woman where she can get the special
article needed, and what it will cost, and
to show her the thing itself, in a friendly
spirit. Such visits would soon revolutionize
the sanitary condition of any community.</p>

<p>Villages need this help even more than
cities, for there they have fewer chances to
know about inventions and perhaps are less
resourceful in making them.</p>

<p>There may be races, as there are individuals,
whom persecution drives to progress&mdash;who
do find means to execute unjust
commands&mdash;but the people a health officer
has to deal with can be better led by
kindness and will learn from teachers, if
the teaching is in the form of example or
demonstration.</p>

<p>It is an incontrovertible fact that to
hasten sanitary reform it is only necessary
to hold out the helping hand; to encourage
the ignorant citizen to ask for instruction
and direction, instead of placing upon him
the task of making bricks without either
clay or straw. There are times and seasons
and individuals at which and on whom the
bludgeon must be used&mdash;the greater good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
covering the lesser evil; but such cases are
less common than present practice would
seem to indicate.</p>

<p>The tenement house mother who has
only one pan for all her needs and one
broken pitcher for all fluids does not readily
understand why she must keep her milk
bottle for milk only. Who is to tell her so
that she will understand?</p>

<p>The men may be shamed into cleaning
up the back yards and alleys by pictures of
such conditions in contrast to what might
result with a little effort. [The famous
Cash Register yards were started in this
way.] Neglected spots have been cleaned
up all over the country by similar influences.
Why does not the health officer take
a leaf from this book of recorded good work
and show conditions known to him? Is he
afraid of hard words from the owner? He
will have the approval and support of all
good citizens.</p>

<p>Health Board regulations may be left at
a house <small>AFTER</small> they have been explained, and
a firm insistence on obedience may then have
an effect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Why should there not be a constant
exhibit of the conditions found within the
boundaries of a district, with the changes
for the better indicated as soon as they
occur?</p>

<p>The Health Board office is now in some
out-of-the-way place, where few people
ever go and where those who do go are
frequently not welcomed. Has the Board
ever asked itself why it is often so misunderstood,
so hampered in its work? What
Board will be the first to take an office on
a busy street and put pictures and samples
with clearly printed legends in the windows&mdash;examples
of the evasion of the plumbing
laws on a T-joint pipe; photographs of a
dairy barn; photographs of a street at daybreak,
showing the few open windows, and
the one or two, if any, open at the top&mdash;these
would serve as texts for the newspapers&#8217;
sermons, sure to be preached, and
back-alley conversations thereon.</p>

<p>Why not? Rival water companies are
allowed to show filters to prove their claims.</p>

<p>The basis of all successful sanitary progress
is an intelligent and responsive public.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>The problem is to visualize cause and
effect to the ordinary individual, too absorbed
in his own affairs to study out the
principle for himself.</p>

<p>The success of the street cleaning brigade,
tried for one season in Boston; the
improvement in the condition of parks
wherever receptacles for wastes have been
placed; the tidy condition of corner lots
where civic improvement leagues have taken
the matter up with the children, all point
to a means neglected by the officials, and
hence to wasted opportunity and delayed
obedience to regulations.</p>

<p>For the position of instructive inspector,
it goes without saying that a trained woman
will be worth more than a man, since most
of the regulations affect or would be controlled
by women.</p>

<p>A gain in the speed of adoption of
sanitary reforms would be comparatively
rapid under a thoroughly qualified woman
as instructive inspector, and that there will
not be any great gain until such a measure
is adopted is the firm belief of the writer.</p>

<p>Mrs. von Wagner&#8217;s work in Yonkers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
begun in 1897 under the Civic League, is
well known. After three years&#8217; trial the
Board of Health established her in the position
of Sanitary Inspector. Her work in
the tenement districts has been most successful.
Several other cities have followed the
example of Yonkers, but the practice is by
no means general. Yet there is no doubt
that it would add efficiency to any Board of
Health.</p>

<p>The most recent experiment was the
employment, the past summer, of an inspector
provided by the Women&#8217;s Municipal
League of Boston, to inspect and devise
means for bettering conditions in a district
of small shops where food is sold. The district
had been found by the Market Committee
of this organization to be in need of
such help. A graduate of the School for
Social Workers was chosen, who carried on
her campaign with the spirit of helpfulness
fostered by her training. She was given a
badge by the Board of Health, who have
been most sympathetic and cordial in their
support. The experiment has been justified
by the results and especially by the reception<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
accorded the inspector by the people
of the district. It has proved that there is a
responsive desire to fulfill the law wherever
its provisions are understood.</p>

<p>Inspection cannot fulfill its purpose until
it is instructive. Man and the law will be in
accord when the benefits of the law to man
are appreciated.</p>

<p>It is incumbent upon the sanitary authorities
to see to it that their efforts are not
wasted on an inert, partially hostile clientele.</p>
